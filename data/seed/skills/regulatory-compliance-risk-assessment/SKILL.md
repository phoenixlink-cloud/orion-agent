CATEGORY:       Risk & Compliance
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 8-12 hours per week (ongoing)

DESCRIPTION
Systematically identifying, monitoring, and assessing regulatory requirements
and compliance risks across the organisation. This covers maintaining the
compliance register, tracking regulatory changes, conducting risk assessments,
and ensuring the organisation stays ahead of its legal obligations.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: BUILD THE COMPLIANCE REGISTER
  Document every applicable law, regulation, and standard:
  - Regulation name and reference number
  - Jurisdiction (national, provincial/state, industry-specific)
  - Key requirements and obligations
  - Responsible department/person within the organisation
  - Compliance status (compliant, partially compliant, non-compliant)
  - Review date (when to reassess)
  - Evidence of compliance (documents, controls, certifications)

  Common regulatory areas:
  - Data protection: GDPR, POPIA, CCPA, LGPD
  - Employment: Labour relations, health and safety, employment equity
  - Financial: Anti-money laundering (AML), tax compliance, financial reporting
  - Industry-specific: HIPAA (health), PCI-DSS (payments), SOX (public companies)
  - Corporate governance: Companies Act, King IV, SEC regulations
  - Environmental: Waste management, emissions, sustainability reporting
  - Consumer protection: CPA, advertising standards, product safety

STEP 2: MONITOR REGULATORY CHANGES
  - Subscribe to regulatory updates from government gazettes and authorities
  - Monitor legal news services (LexisNexis, Practical Law, industry associations)
  - Attend industry compliance forums and conferences
  - Maintain relationships with external legal counsel for regulatory guidance
  - When a new regulation is identified:
    * Assess applicability: Does this affect our organisation?
    * Assess impact: What changes are needed? (Policies, processes, systems, training)
    * Assess timeline: When must we comply? Grace period?
    * Develop an implementation plan with milestones
    * Report to leadership with risk assessment and resource requirements

STEP 3: CONDUCT ANNUAL COMPLIANCE RISK ASSESSMENT
  Risk assessment methodology:
  a) Identify compliance risks:
     - Review the compliance register for areas of exposure
     - Interview department heads on compliance challenges
     - Review past audit findings, incidents, and near-misses
     - Assess industry trends and peer compliance failures
  b) Assess each risk:
     LIKELIHOOD: 1 (Rare) to 5 (Almost certain)
     IMPACT: 1 (Negligible) to 5 (Catastrophic)
     - Financial impact (fines, penalties, legal costs)
     - Reputational impact (media, customer trust, brand)
     - Operational impact (business disruption, license revocation)
     RISK SCORE = Likelihood x Impact
  c) Prioritise and mitigate:
     RED (15-25): Immediate action, board reporting
     AMBER (8-14): Mitigation plan within 30 days
     GREEN (1-7): Monitor, review quarterly
  d) Document controls:
     For each risk, document the controls in place and their effectiveness
     Identify control gaps and assign remediation owners

STEP 4: REPORT TO LEADERSHIP
  Quarterly compliance report:
  1. Compliance register summary: Total obligations, compliance rate
  2. Regulatory changes: New or amended regulations with impact assessment
  3. Risk heatmap: Visual representation of compliance risk landscape
  4. Top 5 risks: With mitigation status and progress
  5. Audit findings: Open items and remediation tracking
  6. Training: Completion rates and upcoming requirements
  7. Incidents: Any compliance breaches or near-misses
  8. Recommendations: Resource needs, policy updates, process changes

STEP 5: CONTINUOUS MONITORING
  - Implement compliance monitoring controls:
    * Automated alerts for regulatory deadlines
    * Periodic spot-checks on high-risk processes
    * KPI dashboards for ongoing compliance metrics
    * Exception reporting from business systems
  - Review and update the risk assessment after significant events:
    * Regulatory changes
    * Audit findings
    * Compliance incidents
    * Organisational changes (M&A, new products, new markets)
