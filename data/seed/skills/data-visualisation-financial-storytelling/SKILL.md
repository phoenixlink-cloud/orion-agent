SKILL: DATA VISUALISATION & FINANCIAL STORYTELLING

SKILL ID:       FA-SK-005
ROLE:           Financial Analyst
CATEGORY:       Communication & Presentation
DIFFICULTY:     Intermediate to Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 2-4 hours per deliverable

DESCRIPTION
Transforming complex financial data into clear, compelling visual narratives
that enable non-financial stakeholders to understand performance, trends, and
implications at a glance. This covers chart selection, dashboard design,
annotation techniques, and the art of building a financial story that drives
action rather than just reporting numbers.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE
  Before creating any visual, determine:
  - WHO: Board? CEO? Operations? Sales? Investors?
  - WHAT they care about: Top-line growth? Margins? Cash? Costs?
  - HOW MUCH detail: Executive summary (1 page) or deep-dive (10+ pages)?
  - ACTION: What decision should this visual support?

STEP 2: CHOOSE THE RIGHT CHART TYPE
  COMPARISON (this vs. that):
  - Bar chart: Compare categories (revenue by product line)
  - Grouped bar: Compare categories across time periods
  - Bullet chart: Actual vs. target with performance bands

  TREND (change over time):
  - Line chart: Continuous trends (monthly revenue, stock price)
  - Area chart: Cumulative values over time (stacked revenue)
  - Sparklines: Compact trend indicators in tables

  COMPOSITION (parts of a whole):
  - Stacked bar: Composition over time (revenue mix by product)
  - Waterfall: Bridge from one value to another (EBITDA bridge)
  - Pie chart: ONLY when showing 2-4 categories (avoid for > 5 slices)

  DISTRIBUTION (spread of data):
  - Histogram: Distribution of values (deal size distribution)
  - Box plot: Statistical spread comparison across groups

  RELATIONSHIP (correlation):
  - Scatter plot: Relationship between two variables
  - Bubble chart: Three variables (x, y, size)

STEP 3: DESIGN THE VISUAL
  Golden rules:
  - Title = the insight, not the label ("Revenue grew 23% YoY" not "Revenue")
  - Remove chart junk: No 3D effects, no gridlines unless needed, no borders
  - Use colour purposefully: Highlight the key data point, grey out the rest
  - Label directly on the chart (no legends that force eye movement)
  - Use consistent scales: Don't truncate Y-axis to exaggerate trends
  - Right-align numbers in tables; format consistently (R, $, %, 1dp)
  - Every chart should answer one question — if it answers two, split it

STEP 4: BUILD THE NARRATIVE
  Financial story arc:
  1. CONTEXT: "Last quarter, we set a target of R10M revenue..."
  2. DATA: "We achieved R9.2M, an 8% shortfall driven by..."
  3. INSIGHT: "The shortfall was concentrated in Segment B, where..."
  4. IMPLICATION: "If this trend continues, full-year revenue will be..."
  5. ACTION: "We recommend accelerating the Segment B pricing review..."

  Narrative techniques:
  - Lead with the conclusion (executives want the answer first)
  - Use the "so what?" test on every slide — if no action follows, cut it
  - Annotate charts with callout boxes highlighting key inflection points
  - Use before/after or this/that comparisons to create contrast
  - End every section with implications and recommended actions

STEP 5: QUALITY ASSURANCE
  [ ] Data matches the source (cross-check totals)
  [ ] Charts are correctly scaled (no misleading axes)
  [ ] Labels and titles are clear and spell-checked
  [ ] Colour is accessible (consider colour-blind readers)
  [ ] Print test: Does it look good in black and white?
  [ ] The "5-second test": Can someone get the main message in 5 seconds?

TOOLS & RESOURCES
- Power BI / Tableau for interactive dashboards
- Excel for quick charts and data preparation
- PowerPoint for static presentations
- Figma / Canva for custom infographics
- Storytelling with Data (Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic) — reference book
- Company brand guide (colours, fonts, chart styles)

QUALITY STANDARDS
- Every chart has an insight-driven title (not a label)
- Zero data errors in published visuals
- Brand-compliant colours and formatting
- Accessible design (colour-blind safe, labelled directly)
- Audience-appropriate level of detail
- Clear call-to-action on every dashboard page
