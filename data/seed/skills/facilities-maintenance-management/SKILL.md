STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DAILY OFFICE WALKTHROUGH

    * Cleanliness: Reception, kitchen, bathrooms, open areas
    * Safety: Fire exits clear, cables secured, no trip hazards
    * Equipment: Printers, AV, HVAC, lighting all operational
    * Comfort: Temperature appropriate, no unusual odours or noise
  - Log any issues found and assign to the appropriate contractor or team

STEP 2: MAINTENANCE REQUEST MANAGEMENT
  - Receive requests via email, service desk, or verbal report
  - Log every request with: Date, reporter, description, location, priority
  - Prioritise using the urgency matrix:
    CRITICAL (< 4h): Safety hazards, water leaks, power outages, security
    HIGH (< 24h): HVAC failure, major equipment breakdown, plumbing
    MEDIUM (< 48h): Minor repairs, furniture issues, cosmetic damage
    LOW (< 1 week): Non-urgent improvements, painting, minor fixtures
  - Assign to the appropriate contractor or internal maintenance person
  - Track progress and follow up until resolution
  - Notify the reporter when the issue is resolved

STEP 3: CONTRACTOR SUPERVISION
  - For cleaning: Conduct weekly quality inspections using a checklist
    * Floors, desks, bathrooms, kitchen, windows, bins, carpets
    * Score each area out of 10; overall target >= 8.5/10
  - For maintenance: Verify work quality before signing off
  - For security: Review incident logs monthly; confirm patrol schedules
  - Provide feedback to contractor managers at monthly meetings
  - Document any performance issues for contract review

STEP 4: HEALTH & SAFETY COMPLIANCE
  - Conduct quarterly H&S audits covering:
    * Fire equipment: Extinguishers inspected, alarms tested, exits clear
    * First aid: Kits stocked and in-date, trained first aiders on-site
    * Electrical: PAT testing current, no exposed wiring
    * Ergonomics: Desk setups appropriate, chairs adjustable
    * Chemical storage: Cleaning products stored safely and labelled
  - Maintain the H&S register and incident log
  - Coordinate annual fire drills and evacuation training
  - Display emergency procedures and contact numbers prominently

STEP 5: OFFICE MOVES & RECONFIGURATIONS
  Planning phase:
  - Define the scope: Who is moving, where, when, why

  Execution phase:
  - Coordinate with IT for phone/network moves
