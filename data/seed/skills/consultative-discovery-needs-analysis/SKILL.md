SKILL: CONSULTATIVE DISCOVERY & NEEDS ANALYSIS

SKILL ID:       SR-SK-002
ROLE:           Sales Representative
CATEGORY:       Selling Methodology
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 1-2 hours per discovery meeting

DESCRIPTION
Conducting structured discovery conversations that uncover the prospect's
true business needs, pain points, decision criteria, and desired outcomes.
This skill uses questioning frameworks (SPIN, Challenger) to position your
solution as the answer to their specific problems rather than a generic pitch.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: PRE-MEETING RESEARCH (15-30 min before every meeting)
  Research the prospect:
  - Company: Revenue, headcount, industry, recent news, competitors
  - Person: Role, tenure, LinkedIn activity, mutual connections
  - Context: Why did they agree to meet? What triggered their interest?
  - Prepare 5-7 open-ended questions tailored to their situation
  - Hypothesis: "Based on my research, I think their main challenge is..."

STEP 2: OPEN THE CONVERSATION
  - Thank them for their time
  - Set the agenda: "I'd like to learn about your business and see if there's
    a fit. I'll ask some questions, share relevant examples, and we can decide
    on next steps. Does that work?"
  - Confirm time available: "We have 30 minutes — is that still good?"
  - Start broad: "Tell me about your role and what you're focused on this year."

STEP 3: SPIN QUESTIONING FRAMEWORK
  S - SITUATION questions (understand their current state):
    "How do you currently handle [process]?"
    "What tools or systems do you use for [function]?"
    "How is your team structured for [area]?"
    (Keep these brief — 2-3 questions max. Don't interrogate.)

  P - PROBLEM questions (identify pain points):
    "What challenges are you experiencing with [current approach]?"
    "Where does the current process break down?"
    "What's the biggest frustration your team has with [area]?"

  I - IMPLICATION questions (amplify the impact of the problem):
    "What happens when [problem] isn't resolved?"
    "How does this affect [revenue/productivity/customer satisfaction]?"
    "What's the cost of doing nothing for another 12 months?"
    (This is where the magic happens — help them feel the urgency)

  N - NEED-PAYOFF questions (get them to articulate the desired solution):
    "If you could solve [problem], what would that mean for your team?"
    "How would [outcome] impact your business goals?"
    "What would success look like 12 months from now?"

STEP 4: MAP THE DECISION PROCESS
  Key questions to ask:
  - "Who else is involved in this decision?"
  - "What's your evaluation process? (Demo, pilot, committee, board?)"
  - "What criteria will you use to compare solutions?"
  - "Is there a budget allocated, or does this need to be approved?"
  - "What's your ideal timeline for having a solution in place?"
  - "Have you looked at other solutions? What did you like/dislike?"

STEP 5: SUMMARISE AND ALIGN
  Before closing the meeting:
  - Reflect back what you heard: "Let me make sure I understand..."
  - Confirm the key pain points and desired outcomes
  - Gauge fit: "Based on what you've shared, here's how we typically help..."
  - Share a relevant customer success story (social proof)
  - Agree on next steps: "The logical next step would be [demo/proposal/intro
    to decision-maker]. Does [date] work?"

STEP 6: POST-MEETING DOCUMENTATION
  Within 1 hour of the meeting:
  - Update the CRM with discovery notes:
    * Key pain points identified
    * Decision criteria and process
    * Stakeholder map (who is involved)
    * Budget and timeline
    * Competitor mentions
    * Next steps and follow-up date
  - Send a follow-up email summarising key takeaways and confirming next steps
  - Begin preparing the tailored proposal or demo

COMMON OBJECTIONS DURING DISCOVERY
"We're happy with our current solution"
  → "That's great. What prompted you to take this meeting?"
  → "If you could improve one thing about your current setup, what would it be?"

"We don't have budget"
  → "I understand. If we could show a clear ROI, how would budget typically get approved?"
  → "Many of our customers started by reallocating existing budget. Would that be possible?"

"We're just researching"
  → "Absolutely. What would you need to see to move from research to evaluation?"
  → "What would make this a priority for your team?"

"Send me some information"
  → "Happy to. To send you the most relevant information, can I ask a couple of quick questions?"
  → (Don't accept this as a brush-off — qualify the interest first)
