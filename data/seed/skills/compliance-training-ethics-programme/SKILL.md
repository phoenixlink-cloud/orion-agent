DESCRIPTION
Designing, delivering, and managing the organisation's compliance training
and ethics programme to ensure all employees understand their legal obligations,
can identify compliance risks, and know how to report concerns. This covers
mandatory training, ethics hotline management, and fostering a culture of
compliance and integrity.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DESIGN THE ANNUAL TRAINING PROGRAMME
  Mandatory training for ALL employees:
  - Code of Conduct and Ethics (annual refresher)
  - Data Protection / Privacy (GDPR, POPIA awareness)
  - Anti-Bribery and Corruption
  - Workplace Harassment and Discrimination
  - Information Security Awareness
  - Health and Safety (role-specific)

  Targeted training for HIGH-RISK roles:
  - Finance: Anti-Money Laundering (AML), fraud prevention
  - Sales: Competition law, anti-bribery, sanctions screening
  - IT: Data security, incident response, access management
  - HR: Employment law, data protection (employee data)
  - Procurement: Conflict of interest, vendor due diligence
  - Management: Whistleblower handling, investigation procedures

  Training delivery methods:
  - E-learning modules (self-paced, trackable via LMS)
  - Instructor-led workshops (for complex or sensitive topics)
  - Scenario-based exercises (case studies, role-plays)
  - Micro-learning (short videos, quizzes, email tips)
  - New starter induction (compliance module on Day 1)

STEP 2: DEVELOP TRAINING CONTENT
  - Keep it relevant: Use real-world scenarios from your industry
  - Keep it engaging: Interactive elements, quizzes, videos (not just slides)
  - Keep it practical: "What would you do?" decision scenarios
  - Keep it current: Update annually for regulatory changes
  - Test comprehension: Quiz at the end with a pass threshold (80%)
  - Issue certificates: Completion certificates for regulatory records
  - Localise: Translate for multi-language workforces if needed

STEP 3: DEPLOY AND TRACK
  - Schedule training via the LMS with automated reminders
  - Set completion deadlines (typically 30 days from assignment)
  - Send weekly reminders to incomplete participants
  - Escalate non-completion to managers after 2 reminders
  - Track completion rates by department (target: 100%)
  - Report to leadership monthly on training compliance

STEP 4: MANAGE THE ETHICS HOTLINE
  - Ensure the hotline is accessible: Phone, email, web form, anonymous option
  - Promote the hotline: Posters, intranet, training materials, payslip insert
  - Receive reports and log in the case management system
  - Triage: Assess severity, assign investigator, set timeline
  - Investigate: Follow the investigation procedure (fair, thorough, confidential)
  - Protect the reporter: Zero tolerance for retaliation
  - Report outcomes to the reporter (where possible without compromising investigation)
  - Track: Number of reports, categories, outcomes, resolution times
  - Report to the board quarterly on hotline activity and trends

STEP 5: FOSTER A COMPLIANCE CULTURE
  Beyond formal training:
  - Leadership tone from the top: Executives model ethical behaviour
  - Compliance communications: Monthly tips, case studies, reminders
  - Compliance champions: Appoint departmental ambassadors
  - Recognition: Acknowledge employees who demonstrate ethical leadership
  - Speak-up culture: Make it safe and encouraged to raise concerns
  - Consequences: Visible enforcement when policies are violated (fairness matters)
  - Survey: Annual ethics and compliance culture survey

STEP 6: MEASURE EFFECTIVENESS
  Training metrics:
  - Completion rate: Target 100% by deadline
  - Quiz pass rate: >= 80% average
  - Satisfaction score: >= 4.0/5.0

  Culture metrics:
  - Ethics survey scores: Trend improving year-over-year
  - Hotline report volume: Increasing reports = healthy culture (people trust the system)
  - Retaliation claims: Zero
  - Compliance incident rate: Decreasing trend
  - Repeat findings in audits: < 5% (training is preventing recurrence)
