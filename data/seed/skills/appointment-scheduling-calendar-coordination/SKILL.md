STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: RECEIVE THE BOOKING REQUEST
  - Capture: Who is requesting, attendees, purpose, preferred date/time,
    duration, room requirements (capacity, AV, whiteboard, video conf)
  - Confirm: Internal or external attendees? Catering needed?

STEP 2: CHECK AVAILABILITY
  - Open the shared calendar system (Outlook/Google Calendar)
  - Check availability of: All attendees, the preferred meeting room,
    any required equipment (projector, video conferencing unit)
  - If conflicts exist, propose 2-3 alternative time slots

STEP 3: BOOK THE MEETING
  - Create the calendar event with:
    * Clear subject line: "[Type] - [Topic] - [Host Name]"
    * Location: Room name + floor/building
    * Duration: Include 5-minute buffer for room turnover
    * Attendees: All participants (required and optional)
    * Body: Agenda, dial-in/video link, parking instructions for externals
    * Attachments: Any pre-read documents
  - Send the invite and confirm receipt with the requestor

STEP 4: SEND REMINDERS
  - 24 hours before: Email reminder to all attendees with any updated details
  - 1 hour before: Brief reminder via Teams/Slack to the meeting host
  - For external visitors: Include building directions, parking info, and
    check-in instructions in the 24-hour reminder

STEP 5: PREPARE THE ROOM
  - 15 minutes before: Verify room is clean and chairs are arranged
  - Set up AV equipment: Test projector, screen sharing, video conferencing
  - Place refreshments: Water, cups, notepads, pens
  - For catering meetings: Confirm delivery time with caterer, set up food
  - Place printed agendas at each seat (if requested by host)

STEP 6: HANDLE CHANGES
  - Rescheduling: Update the calendar event, notify all attendees, rebook room
  - Cancellation: Cancel the event, release the room, cancel catering orders
  - Running late: Notify waiting attendees with an estimated new start time
  - Room change: Update the invite, place signage at the original room door

STEP 7: POST-MEETING
  - Verify the room is cleared and reset for the next booking
  - Report any equipment issues to IT/facilities
  - Log catering costs for budget tracking

SCHEDULING CONFLICT RESOLUTION MATRIX
