SKILL: CHANGE CONTROL & SCOPE MANAGEMENT

SKILL ID:       PM-SK-005
ROLE:           Project Manager
CATEGORY:       Governance & Control
DIFFICULTY:     Intermediate to Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 1-3 hours per change request

DESCRIPTION
Managing changes to project scope, schedule, and budget through a formal
change control process that ensures all modifications are evaluated, approved,
and documented before implementation. This skill prevents scope creep and
ensures the project remains aligned with its approved objectives.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: RECEIVE CHANGE REQUEST
  - Accept changes only through the formal Change Request (CR) form
  - Capture: Description, reason, requestor, urgency, affected deliverables
  - Log in the change register with a unique CR number

STEP 2: ASSESS IMPACT
  Analyse the impact on:
  - Scope: What new work is added or removed?
  - Schedule: How does this affect the timeline and critical path?
  - Budget: Additional cost or savings?
  - Quality: Any impact on deliverable quality or testing?
  - Risk: Does this introduce new risks?
  - Resources: Additional or different resources needed?

  Document the impact assessment clearly with quantified estimates.

STEP 3: PRESENT OPTIONS
  For each change request, present:
  Option A: Approve as requested (with full impact quantified)
  Option B: Modified version (reduced scope/phased approach)
  Option C: Reject (maintain current baseline)
  Include PM recommendation with rationale.

STEP 4: OBTAIN APPROVAL
  Approval authority based on impact:
  - Minor (< 5% budget/schedule): PM can approve
  - Moderate (5-15%): Sponsor approval required
  - Major (> 15%): Steering committee approval required

STEP 5: IMPLEMENT AND UPDATE BASELINE
  If approved:
  - Update the project plan (scope, schedule, budget)
  - Re-baseline with the approved changes
  - Communicate changes to all affected stakeholders
  - Update the change register with decision and implementation date

  If rejected:
  - Document the decision and rationale
  - Communicate to the requestor
  - Close the CR in the register

STEP 6: PREVENT SCOPE CREEP
  Proactive measures:
  - Clear scope statement signed off at project start
  - "If it's not in the scope, it needs a CR" — enforce consistently
  - Track scope changes cumulatively — report total impact to sponsor
  - Never accept verbal scope changes — always require a written CR
  - Educate stakeholders on the change process early in the project

TOOLS & RESOURCES
- Change Request form template
- Change register / log (spreadsheet or project tool)
- Impact assessment template
- Updated project plan reflecting approved changes
- Approval workflow (email chain or digital approval tool)

QUALITY STANDARDS
- All changes processed through formal CR process (zero informal changes)
- Impact assessment completed within 5 business days
- Approval obtained before any change work begins
- Change register: 100% of CRs logged and tracked to closure
- Baseline updated within 2 days of CR approval
- Cumulative scope change reported to sponsor monthly
