SKILL: QUALITY ASSURANCE & AGENT COACHING

SKILL ID:       CS-SK-002
ROLE:           Customer Service Manager
CATEGORY:       Quality & Development
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 6-10 hours per week (ongoing)

DESCRIPTION
Implementing and managing a quality assurance programme that evaluates customer
interactions across all channels, provides structured coaching to agents, and
drives continuous improvement in service delivery. This covers QA scorecard
design, calibration sessions, coaching frameworks, and linking quality to KPIs.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DESIGN THE QA SCORECARD
  Standard evaluation criteria (weighted):
  GREETING & PROFESSIONALISM (10%):
  - Used correct greeting, introduced themselves, set expectations
  ATTENTIVE ENGAGEMENT (15%):
  - Understood the issue, asked clarifying questions, confirmed understanding
  KNOWLEDGE & ACCURACY (20%):
  - Provided correct information, followed procedures, used knowledge base
  EMPATHY & TONE (15%):
  - Showed genuine empathy, appropriate tone, customer felt heard
  RESOLUTION (20%):
  - Resolved the issue (or correctly escalated), first contact resolution
  EFFICIENCY (10%):
  - Handled within reasonable time, no unnecessary transfers or holds
  COMPLIANCE (10%):
  - Followed mandatory scripts/disclosures, data protection, security verification

  Scoring: 1-5 per criterion, weighted total = quality score (target >= 85%)

STEP 2: CONDUCT QA AUDITS
  Monthly audit volume per agent:
  - 5-10 interactions per agent per month (across channels)
  - Random selection + targeted selection (complaints, long calls, transfers)
  - Include all channels: Phone calls, emails, chats, social responses

  Audit process:
  - Review the interaction against the scorecard
  - Score each criterion with specific notes and evidence
  - Identify strengths to reinforce and areas for improvement
  - Flag critical failures (data breach, compliance violation, rudeness)
    for immediate escalation

STEP 3: CALIBRATION SESSIONS (Monthly)
  - Bring QA reviewers and team leads together
  - Review 3-5 sample interactions as a group
  - Each person scores independently, then compare
  - Discuss and align on scoring standards
  - Goal: < 5% variance between reviewers on the same interaction
  - Update scorecard definitions if misalignment is found

STEP 4: DELIVER COACHING (Weekly 1:1 sessions, 30 min per agent)
  Coaching framework (GROW):
  G - GOAL: What does the agent want to improve?
  R - REALITY: What do the QA scores and data show?
  O - OPTIONS: What approaches could improve performance?
  W - WILL: What specific action will they commit to?

  Session structure:
  - Start positive: Highlight 1-2 things they did well
  - Review QA scores: Show trend over past 4 weeks
  - Focus on 1-2 improvement areas (don't overwhelm)
  - Play back a specific interaction as an example
  - Role-play the improved approach
  - Agree on specific, measurable actions for next week
  - Document the session and action items

STEP 5: TRACK IMPROVEMENT
  Individual agent dashboard:
  - QA score trend (weekly, monthly)
  - CSAT scores for their interactions
  - FCR rate, AHT, and adherence to schedule
  - Coaching attendance and action item completion
  - Improvement trajectory vs. target

  Identify patterns:
  - Top performers: What do they do differently? Can we codify it?
  - Struggling agents: Is it knowledge, skill, or motivation?
  - Common gaps: If multiple agents fail the same criterion, it's a
    training issue, not an individual issue

STEP 6: RECOGNITION AND CONSEQUENCES
  High performers:
  - Public recognition in team meetings
  - Quality awards (monthly/quarterly)
  - Career development opportunities
  - First consideration for promotions

  Persistent low performers:
  - Increased coaching frequency
  - Targeted training programme
  - Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) if no improvement after 60 days
  - Escalate to HR if PIP targets not met
