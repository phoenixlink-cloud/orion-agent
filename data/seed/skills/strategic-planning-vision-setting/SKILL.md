SKILL: STRATEGIC PLANNING & VISION SETTING

SKILL ID:       CEO-SK-001
ROLE:           Chief Executive Officer
CATEGORY:       Strategy & Leadership
DIFFICULTY:     Expert
ESTIMATED TIME: Ongoing (strategic planning cycle: quarterly + annual offsite)

DESCRIPTION
Defining the organisation's long-term vision, mission, and strategic direction,
then translating that vision into a coherent strategic plan with measurable
objectives, resource allocation priorities, and execution milestones. This is
the CEO's most fundamental responsibility — ensuring the organisation knows
where it's going, why, and how it will get there.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: ENVIRONMENTAL SCANNING & SITUATION ANALYSIS
  Before setting strategy, understand the landscape:

  EXTERNAL ANALYSIS:
  - PESTEL: Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal trends
  - Industry analysis: Porter's Five Forces (competition, substitutes, suppliers,
    buyers, new entrants)
  - Market sizing: TAM (Total Addressable Market), SAM, SOM
  - Competitor analysis: Positioning, strengths, weaknesses, strategic moves
  - Customer trends: Shifting needs, preferences, pain points, buying behaviour
  - Technology disruption: What emerging technologies could reshape the industry?
  - Regulatory changes: New laws or regulations on the horizon

  INTERNAL ANALYSIS:
  - Financial health: Revenue trends, margins, cash position, balance sheet
  - Capabilities: What are we uniquely good at? (Core competencies)
  - Culture: Employee engagement, values alignment, organisational health
  - Talent: Do we have the right people for the next phase of growth?
  - Technology: Are our systems and infrastructure fit for purpose?
  - SWOT: Synthesise into Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats

STEP 2: DEFINE THE VISION AND MISSION
  VISION (aspirational, 10+ year horizon):
  - What does the world look like when we succeed?
  - Inspiring, ambitious, and memorable
  - Example: "To be the most trusted [industry] partner in [market]"

  MISSION (what we do, for whom, and why):
  - Clear, concise, actionable
  - Example: "We help [customers] achieve [outcome] through [approach]"

  VALUES (how we operate):
  - 3-5 core values that guide behaviour and decision-making
  - Must be authentic (descriptive of actual culture, not aspirational fiction)
  - Must be actionable (can be used to make hiring, firing, and promotion decisions)

STEP 3: SET STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES (3-5 Year Horizon)
  Define 4-6 strategic priorities:
  - Each with a clear, measurable objective
  - Use the Balanced Scorecard framework:
    FINANCIAL: Revenue, profitability, cash flow, shareholder return
    CUSTOMER: Market share, customer satisfaction, retention, NPS
    INTERNAL PROCESSES: Operational efficiency, innovation, quality
    LEARNING & GROWTH: Talent, culture, technology, capabilities

  Example strategic objectives:
  - "Grow revenue from R100M to R250M by 2028 through organic growth and 1-2 acquisitions"
  - "Achieve market leadership in [segment] with >= 25% market share"
  - "Build a world-class technology platform that enables 10x scale"
  - "Develop a leadership pipeline with internal succession for all C-suite roles"

STEP 4: DEVELOP THE STRATEGIC PLAN
  For each strategic objective:
  - Key initiatives: What major projects or programmes will deliver this?
  - Resource requirements: People, capital, technology
  - Timeline: Milestones and target dates
  - Owner: Which C-suite executive is accountable?
  - Risks: What could prevent success? Mitigation strategies?
  - Investment: How much capital and opex is required?
  - KPIs: How will we measure progress?

  Prioritise ruthlessly:
  - Not everything can be priority #1 — choose the vital few
  - Say "no" to good ideas that don't serve the strategy
  - Resource allocation follows strategic priority (budget = strategy made real)

STEP 5: COMMUNICATE THE STRATEGY
  To the Board: Formal presentation for approval and alignment
  To the executive team: Deep-dive working sessions on execution
  To all employees: Town hall, video message, written strategy summary
  To investors: Investor day or annual presentation
  To customers/partners: How the strategy benefits them

  Communication rules:
  - Simple: If you can't explain it in 5 minutes, it's too complex
  - Memorable: One-line strategy statement everyone can repeat
  - Connected: Show every team how their work connects to the strategy
  - Repeated: Strategy needs to be communicated 10x more than you think
  - Honest: Acknowledge challenges and trade-offs

STEP 6: EXECUTE AND REVIEW
  Quarterly strategy review (executive team):
  - Progress against strategic KPIs
  - Are the initiatives on track? If not, what's the recovery plan?
  - Has anything changed in the external environment that requires pivot?
  - Resource reallocation decisions
  - New opportunities or threats to assess

  Annual strategy refresh (offsite with executive team):
  - Full environmental scan update
  - Assess: Are our strategic priorities still the right ones?
  - Adjust objectives and initiatives for the next 3-5 years
  - Update the strategic plan document
  - Present to the Board for approval

  The CEO's role: Hold the team accountable for execution while keeping
  the long-term vision front and centre. Balance "what's urgent today"
  with "what matters in 5 years."
