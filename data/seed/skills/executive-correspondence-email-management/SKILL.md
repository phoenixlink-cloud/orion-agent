SKILL: EXECUTIVE CORRESPONDENCE & EMAIL MANAGEMENT

SKILL ID:       EA-SK-004
ROLE:           Executive Assistant
CATEGORY:       Communications
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 1-2 hours daily

DESCRIPTION
Managing the executive's inbox, drafting professional correspondence, screening
communications, and ensuring nothing critical falls through the cracks. This
skill requires excellent judgement about what warrants the executive's direct
attention vs. what can be handled independently or delegated.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DAILY INBOX TRIAGE (First thing each morning)
  Sort incoming emails into categories:
  URGENT/ACTION:   Requires executive's personal response today
  RESPOND ON BEHALF: Routine items the EA can handle directly
  SCHEDULE:        Meeting requests — process through calendar
  FYI/FILE:        Informational — flag and file for reference
  DELETE/SPAM:     Unsubscribe and remove

STEP 2: DRAFT CORRESPONDENCE
  When writing on behalf of the executive:
  - Match the executive's voice, tone, and style
  - Keep it concise: Executives value brevity
  - Use proper salutations and sign-offs for the audience
  - For sensitive topics: Draft and send to executive for review first
  - Never commit the executive to anything without explicit approval

  Email structure:
  - Subject: Clear, specific, action-oriented
  - Opening: Purpose in the first sentence
  - Body: Key points, structured with bullets if complex
  - Close: Clear next step or call to action
  - Signature: Executive's full signature block

STEP 3: MANAGE RESPONSE EXPECTATIONS
  - Acknowledge receipt of important emails within 2 hours:
    "Thank you for your email. [Executive Name] has received this and will
     respond by [date]. In the meantime, please contact me if you need
     anything further."
  - Track pending responses with a follow-up system
  - Remind the executive of overdue responses in the daily briefing

STEP 4: CONFIDENTIAL CORRESPONDENCE
  - Mark and handle as per company classification policy
  - Never forward confidential emails without explicit permission
  - Use encrypted channels for sensitive content
  - Maintain a separate filing structure for confidential correspondence
  - When in doubt about sensitivity, treat it as confidential

TOOLS & RESOURCES
- Microsoft Outlook (rules, categories, quick steps, templates)
- Email templates library (acknowledgements, declines, standard responses)
- Grammarly or similar writing assistant
- Secure email/encryption tools
- Contact management system (Outlook contacts, CRM)

QUALITY STANDARDS
- Inbox triage: Completed by 8:30 AM daily
- Response acknowledgement: Within 2 hours for priority items
- Draft quality: Zero typos, correct tone, executive-approved
- Confidentiality: Zero breaches or misdirected emails
- Follow-up tracking: 100% of pending items tracked
