SKILL: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS & CHART READING

SKILL ID:       FX-SK-001
ROLE:           Professional Forex Trader
CATEGORY:       Market Analysis
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 1-3 hours daily (pre-market and intra-session analysis)

DESCRIPTION
Analysing price charts across multiple timeframes to identify high-probability
trade setups using price action, support/resistance levels, chart patterns,
candlestick formations, and technical indicators. This skill forms the core
of most trading strategies and provides the timing framework for entries and
exits in the forex market.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: MULTI-TIMEFRAME ANALYSIS (Top-Down Approach)
  Always analyse from higher to lower timeframes:

  MONTHLY/WEEKLY (Context):
  - Identify the long-term trend direction (uptrend, downtrend, range)
  - Mark major support and resistance levels
  - Note key swing highs and lows

  DAILY (Direction):
  - Confirm the intermediate trend within the weekly context
  - Identify the current market structure (higher highs/lows or lower highs/lows)
  - Mark recent swing points and key levels
  - Check for chart patterns forming (head & shoulders, double top/bottom, triangles)

  4-HOUR / 1-HOUR (Timing):
  - Fine-tune entry and exit levels
  - Identify short-term structure breaks and momentum shifts
  - Look for confirmation signals at key levels from higher timeframes
  - This is where most swing trade entries are executed

  15-MIN / 5-MIN (Precision — for day traders):
  - Precise entry timing within the 1H/4H setup
  - Manage active trades (trailing stops, partial exits)
  - Not for analysis — only for execution precision

  Rule: NEVER trade against the higher timeframe trend without exceptional reason.

STEP 2: SUPPORT & RESISTANCE ANALYSIS
  Types of support/resistance:
  - HORIZONTAL: Previous swing highs/lows where price reversed
  - TRENDLINES: Diagonal lines connecting swing highs or lows
  - MOVING AVERAGES: 20 EMA (short-term), 50 EMA (medium), 200 SMA (long-term)
  - FIBONACCI RETRACEMENTS: 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% (measured from significant swings)
  - ROUND NUMBERS: Psychological levels (1.1000, 1.0500, etc.)
  - PIVOT POINTS: Daily, weekly, monthly calculated levels

  Best practices:
  - S/R are ZONES, not exact lines (use a range, not a single price)
  - The more times a level is tested, the more likely it breaks eventually
  - Broken support becomes resistance (and vice versa) — "role reversal"
  - Confluence: When multiple S/R types align, the level is stronger
  - Mark only the 3-5 most significant levels — don't clutter the chart

STEP 3: CANDLESTICK PATTERNS
  Key reversal patterns (at support/resistance):
  - PIN BAR (Hammer/Shooting Star): Long wick, small body = rejection
  - ENGULFING: Large candle fully engulfs the previous candle
  - DOJI: Open and close nearly equal = indecision
  - MORNING/EVENING STAR: Three-candle reversal pattern
  - INSIDE BAR: Candle contained within previous candle = consolidation before breakout

  Rules:
  - Candlestick patterns ONLY matter at key levels (not in the middle of nowhere)
  - Higher timeframe patterns are more reliable than lower timeframe
  - Always wait for the candle to CLOSE before acting (no anticipation)
  - A pin bar at a weekly support level is far more powerful than at a 5-min level

STEP 4: CHART PATTERNS
  Reversal patterns:
  - HEAD & SHOULDERS / INVERSE H&S: Three peaks, middle highest
  - DOUBLE TOP / DOUBLE BOTTOM: Two peaks/troughs at same level
  - RISING/FALLING WEDGE: Converging trendlines against the trend

  Continuation patterns:
  - FLAGS & PENNANTS: Brief consolidation within a strong trend
  - TRIANGLES: Ascending, descending, symmetrical (breakout direction)
  - RECTANGLES: Horizontal consolidation between S/R

  How to trade patterns:
  - Wait for the BREAKOUT (don't anticipate)
  - Measure the pattern height for the target (measured move)
  - Place stop-loss beyond the pattern boundary
  - Confirm with volume (if available) — breakout should have volume expansion

STEP 5: TECHNICAL INDICATORS (Supporting, not primary)
  Trend indicators:
  - MOVING AVERAGES: 20/50/200 crossovers, price relation to MAs
  - MACD: Momentum and trend direction, divergence signals
  - ADX: Trend strength (> 25 = trending, < 20 = ranging)

  Momentum indicators:
  - RSI (14): Overbought (> 70) / Oversold (< 30), divergence signals
  - Stochastic: Overbought/oversold, crossover signals in ranging markets

  Volatility:
  - BOLLINGER BANDS: Squeeze (low vol) preceding expansion (breakout)
  - ATR (Average True Range): Measure volatility for stop-loss sizing

  Rules:
  - Indicators CONFIRM price action — they don't replace it
  - Use maximum 2-3 indicators (more = analysis paralysis)
  - Understand what each indicator measures (don't duplicate — RSI and Stochastic
    both measure momentum, so using both is redundant)
  - Divergence between price and indicator is one of the most powerful signals

STEP 6: BUILD YOUR DAILY ANALYSIS ROUTINE
  Pre-market (30-60 min before your session):
  1. Check overnight economic events and news releases
  2. Review the economic calendar for today's scheduled events
  3. Scan weekly and daily charts of your watchlist pairs
  4. Mark key levels and note the bias (bullish/bearish/neutral)
  5. Identify 2-3 potential trade setups with entry, SL, and TP defined
  6. Write the plan: "If price does X, I will do Y"

  During session:
  - Monitor your setups — DO NOT add new setups impulsively
  - Execute only when your predefined criteria are met
  - Manage open positions per your trade management rules

  Post-session (15-30 min):
  - Review any trades taken: Did I follow the plan?
  - Journal the day: What happened, what I did, what I learned
  - Prepare the watchlist for tomorrow
