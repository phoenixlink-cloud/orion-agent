SKILL: RISK MANAGEMENT & POSITION SIZING

SKILL ID:       FX-SK-002
ROLE:           Professional Forex Trader
CATEGORY:       Risk Management
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced (most critical skill)
ESTIMATED TIME: Calculated before every trade; reviewed weekly

DESCRIPTION
The single most important skill in professional trading. Risk management
determines position sizes, stop-loss placement, maximum exposure, and
drawdown limits to ensure capital preservation and long-term survival.
A trader can have a 40% win rate and still be highly profitable with
proper risk management. Conversely, a 90% win rate means nothing if one
bad trade wipes out the account.

THE CARDINAL RULES OF RISK MANAGEMENT
1. NEVER risk more than 1-2% of your account on a single trade
2. ALWAYS use a stop-loss (no exceptions, no "mental stops")
3. NEVER move your stop-loss further from entry to "give it more room"
4. Position size is calculated BEFORE entry, not adjusted after
5. Correlation counts: 3 similar trades = 3x the risk, not 1x
6. If you hit your daily/weekly loss limit, STOP TRADING (walk away)
7. Risk management rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE — they protect you from yourself

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DEFINE YOUR RISK PARAMETERS
  Account risk per trade:
  - Conservative: 0.5% per trade (capital preservation focus)
  - Standard: 1.0% per trade (balanced approach)
  - Aggressive: 2.0% per trade (maximum — never exceed this)
  
  Daily loss limit: 3-5% of account equity (stop trading if reached)
  Weekly loss limit: 5-8% of account equity
  Maximum drawdown: 10-15% of account equity (trigger full strategy review)
  Maximum open exposure: 5-6% across all open positions
  Maximum correlated exposure: 3% in correlated pairs (e.g., EUR/USD + GBP/USD)

STEP 2: CALCULATE POSITION SIZE
  Formula:
  Position Size (lots) = (Account Equity x Risk %) / (Stop Loss in pips x Pip Value)

  Example:
  Account: ,000
  Risk per trade: 1% = 
  Stop loss: 50 pips
  Pair: EUR/USD (pip value for 1 standard lot = )

  Position Size =  / (50 pips x ) =  /  = 0.20 lots (2 mini lots)

  ALWAYS calculate this BEFORE entering the trade.
  NEVER adjust position size to "make more" on a "sure thing" (there are no sure things).

STEP 3: STOP-LOSS PLACEMENT
  Where to place the stop-loss:
  - BELOW/ABOVE the nearest significant support/resistance level
  - BELOW/ABOVE the pattern boundary (e.g., below the neckline of a H&S)
  - Using ATR: 1.5x ATR below entry for long trades (accounts for volatility)
  - Beyond the wick of the entry candle (for pin bar entries)
  
  Stop-loss rules:
  - The stop must be at a level where your trade idea is INVALIDATED
    (not just "far enough" to survive a spike)
  - If the logical stop-loss is too far (makes position size too small to be
    worthwhile), SKIP THE TRADE — don't use a tighter stop to fit the trade
  - Once placed, the stop can be MOVED TO BREAKEVEN or TRAILED in your favour
  - NEVER move the stop further from entry

STEP 4: TAKE-PROFIT & RISK-REWARD
  Minimum risk-reward ratio: 1:2 (risk  to make )
  Preferred: 1:3 or better

  Take-profit placement:
  - At the next significant support/resistance level
  - At a measured move target (pattern height projected from breakout)
  - At a Fibonacci extension level (1.272, 1.618)
  - Using a trailing stop to capture extended moves

  Partial profit strategy:
  - Take 50% off at 1:1 RR, move stop to breakeven, let rest run to 1:2 or 1:3
  - OR: Take 33% at each of three targets (1:1, 1:2, 1:3)
  - Document your partial exit strategy in the trading plan

  Why risk-reward matters:
  With 1:2 RR, you only need 34% win rate to break even
  With 1:3 RR, you only need 25% win rate to break even
  This is why risk management is more important than being "right"

STEP 5: MANAGE OPEN POSITION RISK
  - Review all open positions at the start of each session
  - Move stop to breakeven after price moves 1:1 in your favour (optional rule)
  - Trail the stop below/above significant swing points as price moves
  - If holding positions into major news events: Tighten stops or take profits
  - Check total portfolio exposure: Are you over your max open risk?
  - Check correlation: Multiple USD-long positions = concentrated USD risk

STEP 6: DRAWDOWN MANAGEMENT
  When in a drawdown:
  - DO NOT increase position sizes to "make it back" (revenge trading)
  - REDUCE position sizes: If down 5%, cut risk per trade to 0.5%
  - REVIEW your recent trades: Are you following the plan? If not, that's the fix
  - TAKE A BREAK: If emotions are running high, step away for 24-48 hours
  - Only resume normal position sizing after demonstrating disciplined trading
    for at least 1-2 weeks

  When on a winning streak:
  - DO NOT increase position sizes dramatically (overconfidence kills)
  - Stick to the plan: Same risk percentage, same discipline
  - The market doesn't know or care about your recent wins

STEP 7: TRACK RISK METRICS
  Maintain a risk dashboard:
  - Current open risk (total % of account at risk)
  - Daily P&L vs. daily loss limit
  - Weekly P&L vs. weekly loss limit
  - Current drawdown from peak equity
  - Average risk per trade (should be consistent)
  - Largest winning trade vs. largest losing trade
  - Consecutive losses (current streak and maximum historical)
  - Expectancy: (Win rate x Avg Win) - (Loss rate x Avg Loss)

POSITION SIZE QUICK REFERENCE TABLE

ACCOUNT: ,000 | Risk: 1% =  | EUR/USD (pip value = /lot)

STOP LOSS    POSITION SIZE    LOTS
20 pips      /()    0.50 lots (5 mini)
30 pips      /()    0.33 lots (3 mini)
40 pips      /()    0.25 lots (2.5 mini)
50 pips      /()    0.20 lots (2 mini)
75 pips      /()    0.13 lots (1 mini + 3 micro)
100 pips     /()   0.10 lots (1 mini)

Key insight: Wider stops = smaller positions. This is CORRECT behaviour.
