STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: INITIAL GREETING
  - Make eye contact and smile as the visitor approaches
  - Stand if seated (shows respect and attentiveness)
  - Deliver greeting: "Good [morning/afternoon], welcome to [Company Name].
    How may I help you?"
  - If on a call, acknowledge the visitor with a nod and a gesture indicating
    you will be with them shortly (< 30 seconds)

STEP 2: IDENTIFY AND VERIFY
  - Ask: "May I have your name and who you are here to see?"
  - Check the visitor against the day's expected visitor list
  - For unscheduled visitors: Contact the intended host to confirm acceptance
  - For high-security areas: Request government-issued photo ID and verify
  - For contractors: Verify work order number and sponsoring manager

STEP 3: DOCUMENTATION
  - Enter visitor details into the visitor management system or log book:
    * Full name, company/affiliation, photo ID number (if required)
    * Host name, department, purpose of visit
    * Arrival time (auto-stamped or manually entered)
  - For first-time visitors to secure facilities:
    * Present the visitor NDA / confidentiality agreement
    * Ensure signature before proceeding
    * File the signed NDA according to retention policy

STEP 4: BADGE ISSUANCE
  - Issue a visitor badge with:
    * Visitor name, host name, date, and access level (colour-coded)
    * Badge must be visibly worn at all times
  - Explain: "Please wear this badge visibly during your visit. It is
    required for access to the building."
  - For recurring visitors: Check if they have a pre-registered profile

STEP 5: HOST NOTIFICATION
  - Notify the host via phone, Teams/Slack message, or email
  - Include: Visitor name, company, arrival time, and location (lobby)
  - If the host is unavailable or delayed:
    * Offer the visitor a seat in the waiting area
    * Offer water, tea, or coffee
    * Provide an estimated wait time
    * If wait exceeds 10 minutes, follow up with the host

STEP 6: ESCORT OR DIRECT
  - For general visitors: Provide directions to the meeting room
  - For high-security areas: Arrange an escort (never allow unaccompanied access)
  - For delivery personnel: Direct to the designated delivery area

STEP 7: CHECK-OUT
  - When the visitor departs, record the departure time in the log
  - Collect the visitor badge
  - Thank the visitor: "Thank you for visiting [Company Name]. Have a good day."
  - If a badge is not returned, flag it in the system and notify security
