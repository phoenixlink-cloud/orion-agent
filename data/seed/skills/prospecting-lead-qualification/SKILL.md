SKILL: PROSPECTING & LEAD QUALIFICATION (BANT/MEDDIC)

SKILL ID:       SR-SK-001
ROLE:           Sales Representative
CATEGORY:       Pipeline Development
DIFFICULTY:     Intermediate to Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 10-15 hours per week (ongoing)

DESCRIPTION
Systematically identifying, researching, and qualifying potential customers to
build a healthy sales pipeline. This covers cold outreach strategies, social
selling on LinkedIn, inbound lead handling, qualification frameworks (BANT,
MEDDIC), and pipeline hygiene to ensure sales effort is focused on the
highest-probability opportunities.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DEFINE YOUR IDEAL CUSTOMER PROFILE (ICP)
  Document the characteristics of your best customers:
  - Industry / vertical
  - Company size (revenue, employee count)
  - Geography / region
  - Technology stack or infrastructure
  - Business challenges your solution addresses
  - Buying triggers (growth, compliance, cost pressure, digital transformation)
  - Decision-making structure (centralised vs. decentralised)

STEP 2: BUILD A TARGET LIST
  - Use sales intelligence tools (ZoomInfo, Apollo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator)
  - Filter by ICP criteria to generate a list of target accounts
  - Within each account, identify key personas:
    * Economic Buyer: Controls the budget (CFO, VP, Director)
    * Technical Buyer: Evaluates the solution (IT Manager, Engineer)
    * Champion: Internal advocate who wants your solution to win
    * User Buyer: End user who will interact with the product daily
  - Aim for 50-100 active target accounts in your pipeline at any time

STEP 3: EXECUTE OUTREACH (Multi-channel approach)
  COLD EMAIL:
  - Personalise: Reference their company, role, or a recent event
  - Keep it short: 3-5 sentences maximum
  - One clear CTA: "Would a 15-minute call this week make sense?"
  - Follow-up cadence: Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, Day 14, Day 21

  COLD CALLING:
  - Research the prospect for 2 minutes before calling
  - Opening: "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I noticed
    [relevant observation]. I'm calling because [value proposition]. Do you
    have 30 seconds?"
  - Goal: Book a meeting, not sell on the phone
  - Handle gatekeepers professionally — they are allies, not obstacles

  SOCIAL SELLING (LinkedIn):
  - Connect with a personalised note (not the default message)
  - Engage with their content: Like, comment, share (genuinely)
  - Share relevant content that positions you as a thought leader
  - Transition from social engagement to a meeting request naturally

  REFERRALS:
  - Ask satisfied customers: "Who else might benefit from what we've done?"
  - Ask after a successful delivery or positive review — timing matters
  - Warm introductions convert at 3-5x the rate of cold outreach

STEP 4: QUALIFY USING BANT OR MEDDIC
  BANT (simpler, good for transactional sales):
  B - Budget: Do they have budget allocated? How much?
  A - Authority: Is this person the decision-maker or an influencer?
  N - Need: Is there a real, acknowledged business need?
  T - Timeline: When do they need a solution? Is there urgency?

  MEDDIC (deeper, better for complex/enterprise sales):
  M - Metrics: What measurable outcomes does the buyer expect?
  E - Economic Buyer: Who controls the budget and final decision?
  D - Decision Criteria: What factors will they use to evaluate?
  D - Decision Process: What are the steps to get to a signed deal?
  I - Identify Pain: What is the specific business pain driving this?
  C - Champion: Who inside the organisation is advocating for you?

  Qualification outcome:
  HOT: Meets all criteria — prioritise and advance aggressively
  WARM: Meets most criteria — nurture and develop the gaps
  COLD: Missing critical criteria — park or disqualify (save your time)

STEP 5: MANAGE PIPELINE HYGIENE
  Weekly pipeline review:
  - Update every deal stage and close date in the CRM
  - Remove stale opportunities (no activity in 30+ days without reason)
  - Ensure pipeline coverage is >= 3x your quarterly target
  - Review stage distribution: Is the pipeline front-heavy or back-heavy?
  - Identify stuck deals and plan specific actions to advance them

  Pipeline stages (example):
  1. PROSPECT: Identified, not yet contacted
  2. CONTACTED: Outreach made, awaiting response
  3. DISCOVERY: Meeting scheduled or completed, needs identified
  4. PROPOSAL: Proposal submitted, under review
  5. NEGOTIATION: Terms being discussed, verbal commitment pending
  6. CLOSED WON: Contract signed
  7. CLOSED LOST: Opportunity lost (document reason)
