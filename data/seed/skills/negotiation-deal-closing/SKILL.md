SKILL: NEGOTIATION & DEAL CLOSING

SKILL ID:       SR-SK-004
ROLE:           Sales Representative
CATEGORY:       Commercial & Closing
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: Variable (1-10 hours per deal depending on complexity)

DESCRIPTION
Navigating the final stages of the sales process including commercial
negotiation, objection resolution, contract terms discussion, and securing
the signed agreement. This skill balances assertiveness with flexibility,
ensuring profitable deals that create long-term customer relationships.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: PREPARE FOR NEGOTIATION
  Before any negotiation:
  - Know your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement)
  - Define your walk-away point (minimum acceptable terms)
  - Define your ideal outcome (best realistic deal)
  - Research the buyer's alternatives and constraints
  - Prepare concession strategy: What can you give? What must you protect?
  - Rank your priorities: Price > Payment terms > Contract length > Scope

STEP 2: NEGOTIATION PRINCIPLES
  - Never negotiate against yourself (don't lower price before they ask)
  - Trade, don't give: "I can offer X if you can commit to Y"
  - Anchor high: Your first offer sets the range
  - Use silence: After stating your position, stop talking
  - Focus on value, not price: "The investment is R500K, which delivers R2M"
  - Never reveal your deadline or desperation
  - Get something for everything: "We can extend payment to 60 days if you
    sign a 24-month contract"

STEP 3: HANDLE PRICE PRESSURE
  "Your price is too high"
  → "Compared to what?" (Understand their benchmark)
  → "Let me walk through the value breakdown..."
  → "Which elements are must-haves vs. nice-to-haves?" (Adjust scope)
  → "If price is the only barrier, I can explore [volume discount / payment
     plan / phased rollout]"

  NEVER: Drop price without getting something in return
  NEVER: Badmouth competitors to justify your price
  ALWAYS: Reframe from cost to investment and ROI

STEP 4: ADVANCE TO CLOSE
  Closing techniques (use the right one for the situation):
  - ASSUMPTIVE: "Shall I send the contract for signature?"
  - SUMMARY: "We've agreed on X, Y, Z — shall we proceed?"
  - TIMELINE: "To hit your go-live date, we'd need signatures by Friday"
  - CHOICE: "Would you prefer the annual plan or the monthly plan?"
  - TRIAL: "If we could address [concern], would you be ready to move forward?"

  Never ask "So, what do you think?" — always propose a specific next action.

STEP 5: NAVIGATE PROCUREMENT
  Enterprise deals often involve procurement:
  - Expect the process: RFP, vendor comparison, legal review, board approval
  - Equip your champion with internal selling tools (one-pager, ROI summary)
  - Be responsive to procurement requests (don't slow down the process)
  - Understand their approval thresholds and decision timeline
  - Offer to participate in committee presentations or Q&A sessions

STEP 6: CONTRACT AND HANDOVER
  Once verbally agreed:
  - Send the contract within 24 hours (speed shows professionalism)
  - Walk through key terms on a call (don't just email and hope)
  - Facilitate legal review: Provide answers to legal queries promptly
  - Negotiate redlines pragmatically (pick your battles)
  - Obtain signature via e-sign tool for speed
  - Celebrate with the customer: "Welcome aboard"
  - Execute a structured handover to the delivery/CS team:
    * Customer context, key contacts, expectations, success criteria
