SKILL: INTERNAL AUDIT & COMPLIANCE MONITORING

SKILL ID:       LC-SK-004
ROLE:           Legal Compliance Officer
CATEGORY:       Audit & Assurance
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 16-40 hours per audit; 4-6 hours per week for monitoring

DESCRIPTION
Planning and conducting internal compliance audits to verify adherence to
policies, regulations, and controls. This covers audit planning, fieldwork,
finding documentation, remediation tracking, and reporting to leadership
and the board on the state of compliance across the organisation.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DEVELOP THE ANNUAL AUDIT PLAN
  - Review the compliance risk assessment to prioritise audit areas
  - Consider: Regulatory requirements, past findings, business changes, industry trends
  - Plan 4-8 compliance audits per year (depending on organisation size)
  - Allocate resources: Internal team, co-sourced with external auditors
  - Present the audit plan to the Audit Committee for approval

STEP 2: PLAN EACH AUDIT
  Audit planning document:
  - Objective: What compliance area are we auditing?
  - Scope: Which departments, processes, time period?
  - Criteria: What regulations, policies, or standards are we testing against?
  - Methodology: Document review, interviews, testing, observation
  - Timeline: Fieldwork start/end, draft report, final report
  - Team: Auditor(s) assigned and their responsibilities
  - Logistics: Access needed, data requests, interview schedules

STEP 3: CONDUCT FIELDWORK
  - Request and review relevant documentation (policies, procedures, records)
  - Interview process owners and staff
  - Test controls: Sample transactions and verify compliance
    * Statistical sampling: Random selection, adequate sample size
    * Test: Is the control operating as designed? Evidence of execution?
  - Observe processes in action where possible
  - Document all findings with evidence (screenshots, copies, notes)

STEP 4: DOCUMENT FINDINGS
  For each finding:
  - CONDITION: What did we observe? (The facts)
  - CRITERIA: What should have happened? (The rule or standard)
  - CAUSE: Why did this happen? (Root cause analysis)
  - CONSEQUENCE: What is the risk or impact? (So what?)
  - RECOMMENDATION: What should be done to fix it?
  - MANAGEMENT RESPONSE: Process owner's agreement and action plan
  - TARGET DATE: When will remediation be complete?
  - PRIORITY: Critical / High / Medium / Low

  Finding ratings:
  CRITICAL: Material non-compliance, regulatory penalty risk, immediate action needed
  HIGH: Significant control weakness, material financial or operational risk
  MEDIUM: Control improvement needed, moderate risk
  LOW: Minor improvement opportunity, best practice recommendation

STEP 5: DRAFT AND ISSUE THE AUDIT REPORT
  Report structure:
  1. Executive summary: Overall opinion, key findings summary
  2. Scope and methodology
  3. Detailed findings with ratings, recommendations, and management responses
  4. Summary of all findings by priority
  5. Appendix: Testing details, evidence references

  Review process:
  - Share draft with process owners for factual accuracy review
  - Incorporate management responses and agreed action plans
  - Submit final report to the Audit Committee and relevant leadership

STEP 6: REMEDIATION TRACKING
  - Log all findings in the remediation tracker
  - Assign owners and target dates for each action
  - Follow up monthly on progress
  - Verify remediation: Re-test the control to confirm the fix works
  - Escalate overdue items to leadership
  - Report remediation status to the Audit Committee quarterly

  Metrics:
  - Findings closed on time: >= 90%
  - Overdue findings: < 10% at any time
  - Repeat findings: < 5% (same finding in consecutive audits = systemic issue)
