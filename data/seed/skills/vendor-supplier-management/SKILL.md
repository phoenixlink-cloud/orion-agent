STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE NEED
  - Determine the service or product requirement
  - Define specifications: Scope, quality, frequency, budget, timeline
  - Check if an existing approved vendor can fulfil the requirement
  - If no suitable vendor exists, proceed to sourcing

STEP 2: SOURCE VENDORS (RFQ / RFP PROCESS)
  - Compile a shortlist of 3-5 potential vendors via:
    * Industry referrals and recommendations
    * Online research and directories
    * Trade shows and professional networks
  - Issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP):
    * Include: Service scope, specifications, timeline, evaluation criteria
    * Set a submission deadline (typically 2-3 weeks)
  - Receive and log all submissions

STEP 3: EVALUATE PROPOSALS
  Use a weighted scoring matrix:

  CRITERIA                WEIGHT    VENDOR A    VENDOR B    VENDOR C
  ---------------------   ------    --------    --------    --------
  Price competitiveness    30%       ?/10        ?/10        ?/10
  Quality / capability     25%       ?/10        ?/10        ?/10
  Experience / references  15%       ?/10        ?/10        ?/10
  Delivery reliability     15%       ?/10        ?/10        ?/10
  Payment terms            10%       ?/10        ?/10        ?/10
  BEE / sustainability      5%       ?/10        ?/10        ?/10
  TOTAL WEIGHTED SCORE               ?           ?           ?

  - Contact references for the top 2 vendors
  - Conduct site visits or demos if applicable

STEP 4: NEGOTIATE THE CONTRACT
  Key negotiation points:
  - Pricing: Volume discounts, annual escalation caps (CPI-linked)
  - Payment terms: Net 30, early payment discounts
  - SLA terms: Response times, resolution times, penalties for non-compliance
  - Contract duration: 12-24 months with renewal/exit clauses
  - Liability and insurance: Minimum coverage requirements
  - Confidentiality: NDA for vendors accessing sensitive areas
  - Termination: 30-60 day notice period, no excessive exit fees

STEP 5: ONBOARD THE VENDOR
  - Issue a signed contract and purchase order
  - Provide: Building access, contact details, reporting procedures
  - Introduce vendor to relevant staff (facilities, finance, security)
  - Set up vendor in the accounting system for invoicing
  - Schedule the initial service delivery and confirm expectations

STEP 6: MONITOR PERFORMANCE
  Monthly tracking:
  - SLA compliance: Were all service levels met?
  - Quality: Any complaints or quality issues reported?
  - Invoicing: Were invoices accurate and on time?
  - Communication: Responsive and professional?

  Quarterly review meeting:
  - Review performance scorecard with the vendor
  - Discuss any issues and corrective actions
  - Identify improvement opportunities
  - Confirm upcoming requirements or changes

STEP 7: ANNUAL REVIEW & RENEWAL
  - Compile annual vendor performance report
  - Benchmark pricing against market rates
  - Decide: Renew, renegotiate, or terminate
  - For renewals: Negotiate improved terms based on track record
  - For terminations: Provide notice per contract, plan transition

TOOLS & RESOURCES
- Vendor management spreadsheet or software (SAP Ariba, Coupa)
- Contract templates (legal-reviewed)
- RFQ/RFP templates
- Vendor scorecard template
- Accounting/ERP system for PO and invoice processing
- Document storage for contracts (SharePoint, Google Drive)

QUALITY STANDARDS
- Vendor SLA compliance: >= 95%
- Contract renewal on time: 100% (no expired agreements)
- Cost savings: 5-10% YoY through negotiation
- Invoice accuracy: >= 98%
- Vendor issue resolution: < 48 hours
- Annual review completion: 100% of active vendors

BEST PRACTICES
- Never rely on a single vendor for critical services (have backups)
- Keep a "hot list" of pre-vetted backup vendors for emergencies
- Document all vendor communications in a shared folder
- Pay vendors on time — it builds goodwill for when you need favours
- Review contracts 90 days before expiry to allow negotiation time
- Maintain professional but firm boundaries — you are the client
