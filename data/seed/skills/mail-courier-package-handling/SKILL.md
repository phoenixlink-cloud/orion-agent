STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: RECEIVE INCOMING MAIL & PACKAGES
  - Accept deliveries from postal service, couriers, and hand-deliveries
  - Inspect packages for damage; note any visible damage on the delivery slip
  - Sign for registered or tracked items; verify tracking number matches
  - For suspicious packages: Do NOT open. Follow the suspicious package protocol
    (isolate, notify security, do not use phones within 5m radius)

STEP 2: LOG ALL ITEMS
  - Enter into the mail log (digital spreadsheet or mail tracking system):
    * Date and time received
    * Sender name and company
    * Recipient name and department
    * Package type (letter, parcel, registered, express)
    * Tracking/reference number
    * Condition on receipt (good / damaged / opened)
  - Photograph damaged items before distribution as evidence

STEP 3: SORT AND CATEGORISE
  Priority sorting order:
    1. URGENT / EXPRESS — Deliver immediately to recipient
    2. REGISTERED / SIGNATURE — Hand-deliver, obtain signature
    3. CONFIDENTIAL / PERSONAL — Deliver sealed to recipient only
    4. STANDARD MAIL — Sort into departmental pigeonholes or trays
    5. MARKETING / JUNK — Discard or place in shared reading area
  - Sort by department first, then by individual within each department

STEP 4: DISTRIBUTE
  - Standard mail: Place in departmental mail trays by 10:00 AM
  - Parcels: Notify recipient via email/Teams with collection instructions
  - Registered items: Hand-deliver and obtain recipient signature in log
  - Confidential items: Deliver personally, sealed, to addressee only
  - If recipient is absent: Hold securely at reception; retry next day
  - Unclaimed items after 5 business days: Return to sender or escalate

STEP 5: OUTGOING MAIL & COURIERS
  - Collect outgoing mail from departmental outtrays by 2:00 PM daily
  - Verify outgoing items have:
    * Correct and complete address
    * Appropriate postage or account code
    * Required customs documentation (for international shipments)
  - Select the appropriate courier service based on:
    * Speed: Same-day, overnight, standard (2-5 days)
    * Cost: Compare rates for non-urgent items
    * Destination: Domestic vs. international
  - Book the courier, generate waybill, and attach to package
  - Log outgoing item with tracking number and expected delivery date

STEP 6: TRACKING & FOLLOW-UP
  - Track high-priority outgoing items until delivery confirmed
  - Respond to recipient queries about expected deliveries
  - Investigate lost or delayed items: Contact courier, file claims
  - Produce a weekly mail volume report for management (optional)
