SKILL: FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS & ECONOMIC CALENDAR TRADING

SKILL ID:       FX-SK-003
ROLE:           Professional Forex Trader
CATEGORY:       Fundamental Analysis
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 1-2 hours daily (ongoing market awareness)

DESCRIPTION
Analysing macroeconomic data, central bank policy, and geopolitical events to
understand the fundamental drivers of currency valuation and predict medium-to-
long-term currency movements. This skill provides the directional bias that
complements technical analysis for higher-conviction trades.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: UNDERSTAND CURRENCY DRIVERS
  A currency strengthens when:
  - Interest rates rise (or are expected to rise) — capital inflows
  - Economic growth is strong (GDP, employment, manufacturing)
  - Inflation is under control (not too high, not deflationary)
  - Trade surplus (exports > imports — demand for local currency)
  - Political stability and investor confidence
  - Safe-haven demand during global uncertainty (USD, JPY, CHF)

  A currency weakens when:
  - Interest rates fall (or are expected to fall) — capital outflows
  - Economic slowdown or recession signals
  - Inflation out of control (erodes purchasing power)
  - Trade deficit (imports > exports)
  - Political instability, policy uncertainty, or sanctions
  - Risk-on sentiment (weakens safe havens, strengthens EM currencies)

STEP 2: MONITOR KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS
  HIGH IMPACT (move markets significantly):
  - Interest rate decisions: Central bank rate changes and forward guidance
  - Non-Farm Payrolls (US): Monthly employment report (first Friday)
  - CPI / Inflation: Consumer Price Index (monthly)
  - GDP: Gross Domestic Product (quarterly)
  - Central bank speeches: Chair/Governor commentary on policy outlook
  - PMI: Purchasing Managers Index (leading indicator of economic health)

  MEDIUM IMPACT:
  - Retail sales, industrial production, housing data
  - Trade balance, current account
  - Consumer confidence and business sentiment
  - Unemployment claims (weekly, US)

  For each release:
  - Know the CONSENSUS FORECAST (what the market expects)
  - The ACTUAL vs. FORECAST difference drives the reaction
  - Better than expected = currency strengthens (usually)
  - Worse than expected = currency weakens (usually)
  - The revision of previous data also matters

STEP 3: CENTRAL BANK ANALYSIS
  Track the Big 7 central banks:
  FED (US): Federal Funds Rate, FOMC meetings, dot plot, QE/QT
  ECB (Eurozone): Main Refinancing Rate, press conferences
  BOE (UK): Bank Rate, MPC minutes
  BOJ (Japan): Policy rate, yield curve control, intervention risk
  RBA (Australia): Cash Rate, forward guidance
  RBNZ (New Zealand): Official Cash Rate
  SARB (South Africa): Repo Rate, MPC statements

  What to track:
  - Current rate and expected trajectory (markets price in expectations)
  - Hawkish vs. dovish tone in statements and speeches
  - Quantitative easing or tightening programmes
  - Forward guidance: What are they signalling about future moves?
  - Market pricing: CME FedWatch, OIS curves for rate expectations

  Key principle: Markets move on EXPECTATIONS, not the actual decision.
  If a rate hike is 100% priced in, the market won't move when it happens.
  The market moves when expectations CHANGE (surprise element).

STEP 4: TRADE THE ECONOMIC CALENDAR
  Pre-event:
  - Identify high-impact events for the upcoming week (Forex Factory, Investing.com)
  - Note the consensus forecast and previous reading
  - Assess: Is positioning already biased? (If everyone expects bullish data,
    the upside surprise may be limited)
  - Decide: Trade before, during, or after the release?

  Strategies:
  BEFORE: Position based on your expectation (higher risk, requires conviction)
  DURING: Don't trade the spike — spreads widen, slippage increases
  AFTER: Wait for the initial reaction to settle (5-15 min), then trade
    the follow-through if it aligns with your analysis (lower risk, clearer signal)

  Rules:
  - Reduce position sizes around major events (volatility increases)
  - Tighten stops on open positions before high-impact releases
  - Never enter a new position in the 30 minutes before a major release
  - If already in a profitable trade, consider taking partial profits before the event

STEP 5: BUILD YOUR FUNDAMENTAL BIAS
  Weekly fundamental review (Sunday/Monday):
  1. Review last week's key data releases and central bank comments
  2. Assess: Has the fundamental picture changed for any major currency?
  3. Rank currencies: Strong (hawkish CB, strong data) to Weak (dovish CB, weak data)
  4. Look for trades that pair a STRONG currency vs. a WEAK currency
  5. Align fundamental bias with technical setups for high-conviction trades

  Example bias framework:
  USD: Hawkish Fed, strong employment → BULLISH
  EUR: Slowing growth, dovish ECB → BEARISH
  → Bias: Short EUR/USD (sell EUR, buy USD)
  → Wait for technical confirmation: Bearish pattern at resistance on EUR/USD

STEP 6: GEOPOLITICAL RISK ASSESSMENT
  Events that move currencies:
  - Elections and political transitions (especially in major economies)
  - Trade wars, tariffs, and sanctions
  - Military conflicts and regional instability
  - Commodity supply disruptions (oil → CAD, NOK; gold → AUD)
  - Pandemic and health crises
  - Sovereign debt concerns

  Response:
  - Safe-haven flows: Money moves to USD, JPY, CHF, gold during crises
  - Risk-on flows: Money moves to AUD, NZD, EM currencies when fears subside
  - Monitor VIX (fear index) as a proxy for market risk appetite
