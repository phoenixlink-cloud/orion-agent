SKILL: LEAD GENERATION & MARKETING AUTOMATION

SKILL ID:       MM-SK-004
ROLE:           Marketing Manager
CATEGORY:       Demand Generation
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 6-10 hours per week (ongoing)

DESCRIPTION
Designing and operating the lead generation engine that feeds the sales
pipeline, including landing page optimisation, lead magnets, nurture
workflows, lead scoring, and the marketing-to-sales handoff process. This
skill bridges the gap between marketing activity and revenue generation.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DESIGN THE LEAD FUNNEL
  Visitor → Lead → MQL → SQL → Opportunity → Customer

  VISITOR: Anonymous website traffic (tracked by analytics)
  LEAD: Known contact who has provided their email (form fill, download)
  MQL (Marketing Qualified Lead): Lead that matches ICP and shows engagement
  SQL (Sales Qualified Lead): MQL accepted by sales after initial outreach
  OPPORTUNITY: SQL with confirmed budget, need, and timeline
  CUSTOMER: Closed-won deal

  Target conversion rates:
  Visitor → Lead: 2-5%
  Lead → MQL: 15-25%
  MQL → SQL: 30-50%
  SQL → Opportunity: 40-60%
  Opportunity → Customer: 20-30%

STEP 2: CREATE LEAD MAGNETS
  High-converting lead magnet types:
  - Whitepapers and ebooks (in-depth industry insights)
  - Templates and checklists (practical, immediately useful)
  - Webinars and video masterclasses (educational, interactive)
  - Free tools or calculators (ROI calculator, assessment quiz)
  - Case studies with detailed results (social proof)
  - Free trials or demos (product-led growth)

  Landing page best practices:
  - One page, one offer, one CTA (no navigation distractions)
  - Headline: Clear benefit statement
  - 3-5 bullet points of what they'll get
  - Form: Minimum fields (name, email, company, role for B2B)
  - Social proof: Logos, testimonials, download count
  - Mobile-responsive and < 3-second load time

STEP 3: BUILD NURTURE WORKFLOWS
  Email nurture sequence (example: post-download):
  Email 1 (Immediate): Deliver the asset + thank you
  Email 2 (Day 3): Related blog post or resource
  Email 3 (Day 7): Case study showing results
  Email 4 (Day 14): Webinar invite or expert interview
  Email 5 (Day 21): Direct CTA — "Book a consultation"

  Nurture rules:
  - Personalise: Use first name, company, and industry-specific content
  - Segment: Different workflows for different personas and funnel stages
  - Trigger-based: Send based on actions (page visits, email clicks, form fills)
  - Respect frequency: No more than 2 emails per week
  - Include unsubscribe and honour opt-outs immediately

STEP 4: IMPLEMENT LEAD SCORING
  Assign points based on:
  FIT (demographic/firmographic):
  +10: Matches ICP industry
  +10: Decision-maker title
  +5: Company size within target range
  +5: Geographic match

  ENGAGEMENT (behavioural):
  +5: Email opened
  +10: Email link clicked
  +15: Downloaded a lead magnet
  +20: Attended a webinar
  +25: Visited pricing page
  +30: Requested a demo or trial

  NEGATIVE SCORING:
  -10: No engagement in 30 days
  -20: Unsubscribed from emails
  -5: Competitor or student email domain

  MQL threshold: >= 50 points → Route to sales for follow-up

STEP 5: MANAGE THE MARKETING-TO-SALES HANDOFF
  When a lead becomes MQL:
  - Auto-notify the assigned sales rep via CRM/Slack/email
  - Include: Lead score, activity history, content consumed, source
  - SLA: Sales must follow up within 24 hours (48 max)
  - Track: MQL acceptance rate, response time, conversion to SQL
  - Feedback loop: Sales provides quality feedback monthly
    (good leads vs. bad leads — use to refine scoring)

STEP 6: MEASURE AND OPTIMISE
  Monthly lead gen report:
  - Leads generated by source (organic, paid, social, email, referral)
  - MQL volume and conversion rate
  - Cost per lead (CPL) and cost per MQL by channel
  - Pipeline attributed to marketing
  - Revenue attributed to marketing (marketing-sourced + marketing-influenced)
  - Funnel conversion rates at each stage
  - A/B test results and optimisation actions taken
