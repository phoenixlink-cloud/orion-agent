SKILL: STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION & STATUS REPORTING

SKILL ID:       PM-SK-003
ROLE:           Project Manager
CATEGORY:       Communication & Governance
DIFFICULTY:     Intermediate to Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 3-5 hours per week

DESCRIPTION
Managing stakeholder expectations through structured, proactive communication
including weekly status reports, steering committee presentations, and
informal stakeholder engagement. This skill ensures all parties are aligned
on project progress, decisions, and upcoming milestones.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: IDENTIFY AND MAP STAKEHOLDERS
  Create a stakeholder register:
  - Name, role, department, influence level, interest level
  - Communication preference (email, meeting, dashboard, verbal)
  - Key concerns or hot-button issues
  - Classify using the Power/Interest grid:
    HIGH POWER, HIGH INTEREST: Manage closely (sponsor, steering committee)
    HIGH POWER, LOW INTEREST: Keep satisfied (executives, regulators)
    LOW POWER, HIGH INTEREST: Keep informed (end users, team members)
    LOW POWER, LOW INTEREST: Monitor (peripheral stakeholders)

STEP 2: DEFINE THE COMMUNICATION PLAN
  AUDIENCE          FREQUENCY    FORMAT                 CONTENT
  Steering comm.    Monthly      Formal presentation    Status, risks, decisions
  Sponsor           Weekly       1:1 meeting or email   Summary, escalations
  Project team      Weekly       Stand-up / team mtg    Tasks, blockers, updates
  End users         Bi-weekly    Email / newsletter     Progress, upcoming changes
  Executives        Monthly      Dashboard / email      KPI summary, highlights

STEP 3: PRODUCE WEEKLY STATUS REPORT
  Standard format (1 page maximum):
  HEADER: Project name, reporting period, PM name, overall RAG status
  
  OVERALL STATUS: [GREEN/AMBER/RED] with one-line summary
  
  KEY ACHIEVEMENTS THIS WEEK:
  - [Milestone completed or deliverable accepted]
  - [Decision made or approval obtained]
  
  PLANNED NEXT WEEK:
  - [Key activities and milestones coming up]
  
  RISKS & ISSUES:
  - [Top 3 risks with scores and mitigation status]
  - [Open issues requiring attention]
  
  DECISIONS NEEDED:
  - [Any decisions required from sponsor/steerco]
  
  METRICS:
  - Schedule: [On track / X days ahead/behind]
  - Budget: [X% spent of Y total; forecast on track]
  - Scope: [X% of deliverables completed]

  RAG status rules:
  GREEN: On track across schedule, budget, and scope
  AMBER: One dimension at risk; mitigation plan in place
  RED: Significant risk to project success; escalation required

STEP 4: PREPARE STEERING COMMITTEE PACK
  Monthly presentation (20 minutes max):
  1. Executive summary: RAG status, key highlights (1 slide)
  2. Schedule: Milestone tracker with actual vs. plan (1 slide)
  3. Budget: Spent vs. forecast, EVM metrics if applicable (1 slide)
  4. Risks & issues: Top 5 with actions (1 slide)
  5. Decisions required: Clear asks for the committee (1 slide)
  6. Next period plan: Key activities and milestones ahead (1 slide)

STEP 5: MANAGE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS
  When delivering bad news:
  - Tell them early — never hide problems hoping they'll resolve themselves
  - Be factual: "We are 2 weeks behind on Workstream B because..."
  - Present the impact: "This means milestone X will shift from March to April"
  - Present options: "We can recover by: (a) adding resources, (b) descoping,
    or (c) accepting the delay. We recommend option (a) because..."
  - Never blame individuals in stakeholder forums

TOOLS & RESOURCES
- Status report template (1-page standard format)
- Steering committee presentation template
- Stakeholder register and communication plan template
- Project dashboard (Power BI, Smartsheet, Monday.com)
- RAG status criteria definitions
- Email distribution lists for each stakeholder group

QUALITY STANDARDS
- Status report: Delivered every Friday by 3 PM (or agreed day)
- Steerco pack: Delivered 2 days before the meeting
- RAG status: Honest and consistent (no "watermelon" projects — green outside, red inside)
- Stakeholder satisfaction: >= 4.0/5.0 on communication quality
- Zero surprises: Escalations happen BEFORE problems become crises
- Decision log: All steerco decisions recorded and tracked
