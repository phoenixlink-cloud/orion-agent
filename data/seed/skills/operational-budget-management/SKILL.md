SKILL: OPERATIONAL BUDGET MANAGEMENT & EXPENSE TRACKING

SKILL ID:       OA-SK-002
ROLE:           Office Administrator
CATEGORY:       Finance & Administration
DIFFICULTY:     Intermediate to Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 4-6 hours per week

DESCRIPTION
Planning, tracking, and controlling the office operational budget including
supplies, facilities, services, equipment, and miscellaneous expenditure.
This skill covers budget preparation, monthly tracking, variance analysis,
expense claim processing, petty cash management, and cost reduction initiatives.

OBJECTIVES
1. Prepare the annual office operational budget with accurate forecasting
2. Track monthly expenditure and report variances within 5% tolerance
3. Process all expense claims and invoices within 5 business days
4. Reconcile petty cash weekly with zero discrepancies
5. Identify and implement cost savings of 5-10% annually
6. Produce monthly budget reports for management review

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: ANNUAL BUDGET PREPARATION (Once per year, Q4)
  - Review the current year's actual expenditure by category
  - Identify trends: Which costs increased? Which decreased? Why?
  - Gather inputs from department heads on upcoming needs
  - Factor in: Inflation (CPI), headcount changes, planned projects, lease renewals
  - Build the budget spreadsheet with line items:
    * Facilities (rent, utilities, maintenance, cleaning)
    * Supplies (stationery, pantry, IT consumables)
    * Services (security, catering, courier, waste)
    * Equipment (furniture, hardware, AV replacement)
    * Events (team events, client entertainment)
    * Contingency (5-10% buffer for unexpected costs)
  - Submit for management approval with supporting justifications

STEP 2: MONTHLY EXPENDITURE TRACKING
  - Record all office-related expenses as they occur:
    * Vendor invoices (matched to POs)
    * Staff expense claims
    * Petty cash disbursements
    * Recurring charges (utilities, subscriptions, leases)
  - Categorise each expense to the correct budget line item
  - Update the budget tracker spreadsheet by the 5th of each month

STEP 3: VARIANCE ANALYSIS
  For each budget line item, calculate:
    Variance = Actual Spend - Budgeted Amount
    Variance % = (Variance / Budgeted Amount) x 100

  Traffic light approach:
    GREEN:  Variance < 5%  — On track
    AMBER:  Variance 5-15% — Monitor and investigate
    RED:    Variance > 15% — Immediate action required

  For RED items:
  - Investigate root cause (price increase? volume spike? one-off cost?)
  - Identify corrective actions (renegotiate, substitute, defer)
  - Report to management with explanation and proposed actions

STEP 4: EXPENSE CLAIM PROCESSING
  - Receive claims from staff with receipts/invoices attached
  - Verify: Valid business expense? Within policy? Receipts match amounts?
  - Check: Correct cost centre and budget code assigned?
  - Approve (within delegated authority) or escalate for manager approval
  - Submit to finance for reimbursement within 5 business days
  - File copies for audit trail

STEP 5: PETTY CASH MANAGEMENT
  - Maintain a petty cash float (typically set at a fixed amount)
  - Issue cash only against a signed petty cash voucher with receipt
  - Record every transaction in the petty cash register:
    * Date, description, amount, recipient, receipt number
  - Reconcile weekly: Cash on hand + vouchers = float amount
  - Replenish when float drops below 30% — submit replenishment request
  - Lock petty cash in a secure drawer/safe when not in use

STEP 6: MONTHLY REPORTING
  Produce a monthly report including:
  - Budget vs. actual by category (table and chart)
  - Variance commentary for any items outside tolerance
  - Year-to-date cumulative spend vs. annual budget
  - Forecast for the remainder of the year
  - Cost saving initiatives status and impact
  - Submit to the Operations Manager by the 10th of each month

STEP 7: COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES
  - Review the top 10 spend categories quarterly
  - Identify opportunities: Vendor renegotiation, volume consolidation,
    switching to alternatives, eliminating waste
  - Benchmark costs against industry standards
  - Implement approved savings and track the impact
  - Target: 5-10% reduction in controllable costs annually

TOOLS & RESOURCES
- Budget tracking spreadsheet (Excel with formulas/pivot tables)
- Accounting software (Xero, QuickBooks, SAP, Sage)
- Expense management tool (Expensify, SAP Concur)
- Petty cash register and secure storage
- Vendor invoices and purchase orders
- Company expense policy document

QUALITY STANDARDS
- Budget variance: < 5% per line item per month
- Expense claim processing: < 5 business days
- Petty cash reconciliation: Zero discrepancies weekly
- Monthly report: Submitted by the 10th of each month
- Cost savings: 5-10% per annum on controllable costs
- Audit readiness: All documentation filed and accessible
