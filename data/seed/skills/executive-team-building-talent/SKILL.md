SKILL: EXECUTIVE TEAM BUILDING & TALENT MANAGEMENT

SKILL ID:       CEO-SK-002
ROLE:           Chief Executive Officer
CATEGORY:       Leadership & People
DIFFICULTY:     Expert
ESTIMATED TIME: Ongoing (10-15% of CEO time)

DESCRIPTION
Recruiting, developing, and retaining a world-class executive leadership team
that can execute the company's strategy. This covers C-suite hiring, performance
management at the executive level, succession planning, and building a cohesive
leadership team that operates with trust, accountability, and shared purpose.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DEFINE THE LEADERSHIP TEAM NEEDED
  Based on the strategic plan, determine:
  - What C-suite roles are needed? (CFO, COO, CTO, CMO, CHRO, CLO, etc.)
  - What capabilities does each role require for the NEXT phase (not current)?
  - Where are the gaps? (Current team vs. future requirements)
  - Which roles need upgrading as the company scales?
  - Build a competency matrix for each executive role

STEP 2: RECRUIT EXECUTIVE TALENT
  When filling C-suite positions:
  - Define the role precisely: Responsibilities, metrics, authority, reporting
  - Cultural fit is as important as capability — the wrong culture fit at the top
    is toxic and will cascade through the organisation
  - Use executive search firms for senior hires (confidentiality, reach, assessment)
  - Conduct rigorous interviewing: Competency-based, case studies, reference checks
  - Involve the Board for C-suite hires (at minimum, Board chair consultation)
  - Assess: Can this person scale with the company, or are they right for now only?
  - Onboard deliberately: 90-day plan, stakeholder introductions, culture immersion

STEP 3: BUILD TEAM COHESION
  Executive team operating rhythm:
  - Weekly executive meeting (60-90 min): Operational updates, decisions, alignment
  - Monthly deep-dive: Rotating focus on each function's strategy and challenges
  - Quarterly offsite (half day to full day): Strategy review, team building, hard
    conversations about performance and priorities
  - Annual strategy retreat (2-3 days): Full strategic planning cycle

  Team effectiveness:
  - Trust: Executives must be able to disagree openly and commit to decisions
  - Accountability: Each executive owns their function's results — no excuses
  - Collaboration: Cross-functional problems are solved together, not in silos
  - Transparency: Bad news shared early, not hidden or sugar-coated
  - Unified front: Disagree in the room, then speak with one voice outside

  The CEO's role in team dynamics:
  - Facilitate productive conflict (disagreement is healthy; avoidance is not)
  - Mediate when executive conflicts become personal or destructive
  - Model vulnerability: Admit mistakes, ask for help, show you're human
  - Hold everyone (including yourself) to the same standard

STEP 4: MANAGE EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE
  Quarterly 1:1 with each C-suite member:
  - Review performance against agreed KPIs and strategic objectives
  - Discuss: What's going well? What's challenging? Where do you need support?
  - Provide candid feedback (positive and constructive)
  - Align on priorities for the next quarter
  - Discuss career development and growth aspirations

  Annual executive review:
  - 360-degree feedback from peers, direct reports, and key stakeholders
  - Self-assessment against role expectations and values
  - CEO assessment: Performance, potential, cultural fit, team contribution
  - Development plan: 1-2 areas for growth with specific actions
  - Compensation review: Aligned with performance and market benchmarks

  When performance isn't meeting the standard:
  - Address early — don't wait for the annual review
  - Be specific: "Here's what I'm seeing, and here's the gap"
  - Agree on a corrective plan with clear timeline (60-90 days)
  - If improvement doesn't materialise: Make the change — the organisation's
    needs outweigh any individual's tenure
  - Handle departures with dignity and respect

STEP 5: SUCCESSION PLANNING
  For every C-suite and critical leadership role:
  - Identify "ready now" successors (could step in within 0-6 months)
  - Identify "ready soon" successors (could step in within 1-2 years with development)
  - Identify high-potential talent 2-3 levels below for long-term pipeline
  - Create development plans: Stretch assignments, mentoring, executive education
  - Review succession plans with the Board annually
  - Test successors: Give them exposure to Board, external stakeholders, and
    cross-functional leadership opportunities
  - CEO succession: Work with the Board to ensure a plan exists for your own role

STEP 6: LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT
  Invest in growing your leaders:
  - Executive coaching for all C-suite members (external coaches)
  - Leadership development programmes for VP and Director level
  - Cross-functional projects to broaden experience
  - External board appointments (for development, with CEO approval)
  - Conference attendance and industry networking
  - Book clubs, peer learning groups, and knowledge sharing
  - Regular feedback culture: Make feedback a normal, ongoing practice

TOOLS & RESOURCES
- Executive search firms: Heidrick & Struggles, Spencer Stuart, Korn Ferry
- Assessment tools: Hogan, DISC, Myers-Briggs, StrengthsFinder
- 360 feedback platforms: Culture Amp, 15Five, Lattice
