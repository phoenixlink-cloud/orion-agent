SKILL: MARKETING ANALYTICS & ROI MEASUREMENT

SKILL ID:       MM-SK-005
ROLE:           Marketing Manager
CATEGORY:       Analytics & Reporting
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 4-6 hours per week (ongoing)

DESCRIPTION
Measuring, analysing, and reporting on marketing performance across all channels
to demonstrate ROI, optimise spend allocation, and make data-driven decisions.
This covers attribution modelling, funnel analytics, A/B testing, and building
executive dashboards that connect marketing activity to revenue outcomes.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: SET UP TRACKING INFRASTRUCTURE
  - Google Analytics 4: Goals, events, conversions, e-commerce tracking
  - UTM parameters: Consistent naming convention for all campaign links
    utm_source=linkedin, utm_medium=paid_social, utm_campaign=q2_webinar
  - Marketing automation: Track email opens, clicks, form fills, page visits
  - CRM integration: Connect marketing data to sales pipeline and revenue
  - Tag management: Google Tag Manager for pixel/script deployment

STEP 2: DEFINE KEY METRICS BY CHANNEL
  WEBSITE: Sessions, users, bounce rate, pages/session, conversion rate
  SEO: Organic traffic, keyword rankings, backlinks, domain authority
  PAID: Spend, impressions, clicks, CTR, CPC, conversions, CPA, ROAS
  EMAIL: List size, open rate, click rate, conversion rate, unsubscribe rate
  SOCIAL: Followers, reach, engagement rate, link clicks, shares
  CONTENT: Page views, time on page, downloads, shares, SEO contribution
  LEAD GEN: MQLs, SQLs, CPL, conversion rates, pipeline generated
  REVENUE: Marketing-sourced revenue, marketing-influenced revenue, CAC, LTV

STEP 3: ATTRIBUTION MODELLING
  Common models:
  FIRST TOUCH: 100% credit to the first interaction (good for awareness)
  LAST TOUCH: 100% credit to the last interaction before conversion (simple)
  LINEAR: Equal credit to all touchpoints (balanced but imprecise)
  TIME DECAY: More credit to recent touchpoints (good for short cycles)
  POSITION-BASED (U-shaped): 40% first, 40% last, 20% split across middle

  Recommendation: Start with Last Touch (simplest), evolve to Position-Based
  as data matures. Report on both Marketing-Sourced (first-touch) and
  Marketing-Influenced (any-touch) pipeline for a complete picture.

STEP 4: BUILD THE MARKETING DASHBOARD
  Executive dashboard (1 page):
  - Total MQLs vs. target (this month, trend)
  - Marketing-sourced pipeline value
  - Cost per lead by channel (bar chart)
  - Campaign performance (top 3 campaigns by ROI)
  - Website traffic and conversion rate trend
  - Overall marketing ROI this quarter

  Operational dashboard (detail):
  - Channel-by-channel performance breakdown
  - Funnel conversion rates at each stage
  - A/B test results and winning variants
  - Budget: Spent vs. planned by channel
  - Content: Top-performing pieces by engagement and conversion

STEP 5: MONTHLY REPORTING CADENCE
  By working day 5 each month:
  1. Pull data from all sources (GA, ads, email, CRM, automation)
  2. Calculate KPIs and compare to targets and prior period
  3. Identify winners and losers (channels, campaigns, content)
  4. Write commentary: What worked, what didn't, what we'll change
  5. Present to leadership with recommendations
  6. Update the marketing plan based on performance insights

STEP 6: OPTIMISE BUDGET ALLOCATION
  Quarterly budget review:
  - Rank channels by CPL, CPA, and ROI
  - Shift budget from underperforming to outperforming channels
  - Test new channels with small budgets (10-15% experimental)
  - Factor in customer lifetime value (LTV), not just immediate conversion
  - Model scenarios: "If we increase paid spend by 20%, what's the projected ROI?"
