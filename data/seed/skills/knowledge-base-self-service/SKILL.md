SKILL: KNOWLEDGE BASE & SELF-SERVICE MANAGEMENT

SKILL ID:       CS-SK-005
ROLE:           Customer Service Manager
CATEGORY:       Knowledge Management
DIFFICULTY:     Intermediate
ESTIMATED TIME: 4-6 hours per week (ongoing)

DESCRIPTION
Building and maintaining a comprehensive knowledge base and self-service
portal that empowers customers to resolve common issues independently,
reducing ticket volume while improving customer satisfaction. This covers
content creation, taxonomy design, search optimisation, and measuring
self-service effectiveness.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: ANALYSE TOP CONTACT DRIVERS
  - Pull the top 20 reasons customers contact support (from ticket categories)
  - Identify which are suitable for self-service resolution:
    * How-to questions (account setup, feature usage, troubleshooting)
    * Policy questions (returns, billing, shipping, terms)
    * Status checks (order tracking, ticket status, account balance)
    * Common errors (password reset, payment failures, setup issues)
  - Target: Deflect 30-40% of ticket volume to self-service

STEP 2: DESIGN THE KNOWLEDGE BASE STRUCTURE
  Taxonomy:
  - Category > Subcategory > Article (max 3 levels deep)
  - Categories aligned with customer journey stages or product areas
  - Consistent article format: Title, summary, step-by-step, screenshots, related articles
  - Search-optimised: Include common search terms and synonyms in article metadata

  Article template:
  TITLE: Clear, question-based ("How do I reset my password?")
  SUMMARY: One-sentence answer (for search previews)
  STEPS: Numbered, with screenshots for each step
  TIPS/NOTES: Common pitfalls or alternative approaches
  RELATED: Links to related articles
  FEEDBACK: "Was this helpful?" thumbs up/down widget

STEP 3: CREATE AND PUBLISH CONTENT
  - Write articles in plain language (Grade 6-8 reading level)
  - Use screenshots and GIFs for visual guidance
  - Test every article: Follow the steps as a new user would
  - Peer review: Have an agent and a non-expert review for clarity
  - Publish and categorise correctly
  - Submit to search engines (sitemap) for organic discoverability

STEP 4: PROMOTE SELF-SERVICE
  - Link to relevant KB articles in email auto-responses
  - Add KB search widget to the website and app
  - Train agents to send KB links during interactions (educate, don't deflect)
  - Include KB links in onboarding emails and product documentation
  - Add chatbot/FAQ widget that searches the KB before creating a ticket

STEP 5: MEASURE AND OPTIMISE
  Track:
  - Article views, search queries, search success rate
  - "Was this helpful?" feedback scores per article
  - Self-service resolution rate (viewed article, didn't create ticket)
  - Top search queries with no results (content gaps)
  - Ticket deflection rate month-over-month

  Monthly maintenance:
  - Review low-rated articles and improve them
  - Create articles for top "no results" searches
  - Archive outdated articles (product changes, deprecated features)
  - Update screenshots and steps after product updates
  - Review search analytics and optimise article titles/metadata
