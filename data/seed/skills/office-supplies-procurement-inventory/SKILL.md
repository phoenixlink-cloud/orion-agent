SKILL: OFFICE SUPPLIES PROCUREMENT & INVENTORY MANAGEMENT

SKILL ID:       REC-SK-005
ROLE:           Receptionist / Front Desk Coordinator
CATEGORY:       Administration & Procurement
DIFFICULTY:     Basic to Intermediate
ESTIMATED TIME: 2-3 hours per week

DESCRIPTION
Managing the procurement, tracking, and replenishment of office supplies,
stationery, pantry items, and cleaning consumables. This includes maintaining
inventory levels, placing orders with approved vendors, tracking expenditure
against budget, and ensuring the office never runs out of essential items.

OBJECTIVES
1. Maintain adequate stock of all essential supplies (never run out)
2. Conduct weekly inventory checks and place orders as needed
3. Stay within the monthly supplies budget (variance < 5%)
4. Source the best value from approved vendors
5. Process supply requests from staff within 24 hours
6. Maintain an organised, accessible supply storage area

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: MAINTAIN THE INVENTORY LIST
  - Keep a master inventory spreadsheet listing every item:
    * Item name and description
    * Category (stationery, pantry, cleaning, IT consumables)
    * Current stock level
    * Minimum stock threshold (reorder point)
    * Preferred vendor and unit cost
    * Monthly consumption rate
  - Update stock levels after every delivery and monthly audit

STEP 2: WEEKLY INVENTORY CHECK
  - Walk through the supply room every Monday morning
  - Count stock of each item and update the spreadsheet
  - Flag any items below the minimum threshold
  - Check expiry dates on perishable items (pantry, toner, batteries)
  - Note any damaged or defective stock for write-off

STEP 3: GENERATE THE ORDER
  - Compare current stock to minimum thresholds
  - Calculate order quantities based on:
    * Monthly consumption rate x 1.5 (buffer for demand spikes)
    * Storage capacity (do not over-order for items with limited shelf space)
  - Consolidate orders by vendor to reduce shipping costs
  - Check the budget: Compare projected spend to remaining monthly budget
  - Prepare the purchase order (PO) or order request form

STEP 4: PLACE THE ORDER
  - Submit orders through the approved procurement channel:
    * Small orders (< budget threshold): Place directly with vendor
    * Large orders (> budget threshold): Submit for manager approval first
  - Confirm: Order number, expected delivery date, total cost
  - File the PO for reconciliation when the invoice arrives

STEP 5: RECEIVE AND VERIFY DELIVERY
  - Check the delivery against the PO: Correct items, quantities, condition
  - Sign the delivery note only after verification
  - Report any discrepancies to the vendor immediately
  - Update the inventory spreadsheet with new stock quantities
  - Store items in the designated locations (FIFO: First In, First Out)

STEP 6: HANDLE STAFF REQUESTS
  - Accept supply requests via email, Teams, or a shared request form
  - Fulfil from existing stock if available (within same day)
  - If out of stock: Add to the next order or place an urgent order
  - For non-standard items: Get manager approval before ordering
  - Track request fulfilment rates for reporting

STEP 7: MONTHLY REPORTING
  - Produce a monthly supplies expenditure report:
    * Total spend vs. budget
    * Top 10 items by spend
    * Any items with unusual consumption spikes
    * Vendor performance (delivery reliability, quality, pricing)
  - Submit to the Office Administrator or Finance
