SKILL: CONTRACT REVIEW & LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT

SKILL ID:       LC-SK-003
ROLE:           Legal Compliance Officer
CATEGORY:       Contract Management
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 2-4 hours per contract review

DESCRIPTION
Reviewing commercial contracts to identify legal risks, compliance obligations,
and unfavourable terms before the organisation commits. This covers standard
contract clauses, risk flagging, negotiation support, and maintaining a
contract management system for tracking obligations and renewals.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: RECEIVE AND TRIAGE THE CONTRACT
  - Log the contract in the review tracker
  - Assess priority: Value, risk level, urgency, counterparty
  - Identify contract type: Sales, procurement, NDA, employment, partnership, SaaS
  - SLA: Standard review within 5 business days; urgent within 48 hours

STEP 2: REVIEW KEY CLAUSES
  For every contract, check:
  PARTIES: Are the correct legal entities named? Jurisdiction?
  SCOPE: Is the scope of work/services clearly defined?
  TERM & TERMINATION: Duration, renewal terms, exit clauses, notice periods
  PAYMENT: Amounts, schedule, currency, late payment penalties, dispute resolution
  LIABILITY: Limitation of liability, indemnification, insurance requirements
  IP: Who owns intellectual property created during the engagement?
  CONFIDENTIALITY: Scope, duration, exceptions, return/destruction obligations
  DATA PROTECTION: Personal data handling, DPA requirement, cross-border transfers
  FORCE MAJEURE: Events covered, notification requirements, consequences
  DISPUTE RESOLUTION: Governing law, jurisdiction, mediation/arbitration clauses
  ASSIGNMENT: Can either party assign the contract without consent?
  REPRESENTATIONS & WARRANTIES: What each party guarantees
  COMPLIANCE: Anti-bribery, sanctions, modern slavery, environmental clauses

STEP 3: FLAG RISKS AND RECOMMEND CHANGES
  For each issue found:
  - RISK: What is the legal/commercial/compliance risk?
  - IMPACT: What could happen if this is not addressed?
  - RECOMMENDATION: Specific proposed change or alternative wording
  - PRIORITY: Must-change (deal-breaker) vs. should-change vs. nice-to-have

  Present findings in a contract review memo:
  - Summary: Overall risk assessment (low/medium/high)
  - Key issues: Top 5 risks with recommendations
  - Redline: Marked-up contract with proposed changes
  - Approval: Conditional approval subject to changes, or rejection

STEP 4: SUPPORT NEGOTIATION
  - Brief the business team on key negotiation points
  - Provide alternative clause wording for contentious issues
  - Participate in negotiation calls if needed for complex legal points
  - Maintain a playbook of standard positions for common negotiation points
  - Know the walk-away points: What terms are non-negotiable?

STEP 5: EXECUTION AND STORAGE
  - Verify final version matches negotiated terms (no "switcheroo")
  - Ensure proper signing authority (check delegation of authority matrix)
  - Obtain signatures via DocuSign or wet-ink as appropriate
  - File executed contract in the contract management system
  - Set reminders for: Renewal dates, termination notice deadlines, milestones

STEP 6: ONGOING OBLIGATION MANAGEMENT
  - Track key dates: Renewals, notice periods, milestones, payment schedules
  - Monitor compliance with contractual obligations (both parties)
  - Flag upcoming renewals 90 days in advance for re-negotiation
  - Conduct annual contract portfolio review: Identify expired, auto-renewed, or
    unfavourable contracts for renegotiation
