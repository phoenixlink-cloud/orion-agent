STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DEVELOP THE CONTENT STRATEGY
  Answer these questions:
  - WHO: Which buyer personas are we creating content for?
  - WHY: What business goals does content support? (Traffic, leads, authority)
  - WHAT: What topics, themes, and formats resonate with our audience?
  - WHERE: Which channels will we distribute content on?
  - HOW: What is our production capacity? (In-house, agency, freelance)

  Content pillars (3-5 core themes):
  - Align with business expertise and audience pain points
  - Each pillar has subtopics that map to keywords and buyer journey stages
  - Example: [Industry trends, How-to guides, Case studies, Product updates, Thought leadership]

STEP 2: MAP CONTENT TO THE BUYER JOURNEY
  AWARENESS (Top of funnel):
  - Blog posts, infographics, social media, videos, podcasts
  - Goal: Attract and educate; no hard sell
  - Example: "The Ultimate Guide to [Industry Topic]"

  CONSIDERATION (Middle of funnel):
  - Whitepapers, webinars, comparison guides, expert interviews
  - Goal: Position as the expert; address specific challenges
  - Example: "How [Company Type] Solved [Problem] with [Approach]"

  DECISION (Bottom of funnel):
  - Case studies, product demos, ROI calculators, free trials, testimonials
  - Goal: Convert; prove value and reduce risk
  - Example: "[Customer Name] Case Study: 3x ROI in 6 Months"

STEP 3: BUILD THE EDITORIAL CALENDAR
  Monthly planning (1 month ahead, 3-month rolling view):
  - Map content pieces to: Publication date, author, channel, persona, funnel stage
  - Balance content types: 60% educational, 20% thought leadership, 20% promotional
  - Align with: Product launches, events, seasonal trends, industry dates
  - Include: Repurposing plans (blog → social → email → webinar → ebook)

  Calendar template columns:
  DATE | TITLE | FORMAT | PERSONA | FUNNEL STAGE | CHANNEL | AUTHOR | STATUS | KEYWORDS
