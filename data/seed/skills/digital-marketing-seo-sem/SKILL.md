STEP 1: SEO STRATEGY
  On-page SEO:
  - Keyword research: Identify target keywords by search volume, difficulty,
    and business relevance (use SEMrush, Ahrefs, Google Keyword Planner)
  - Map keywords to pages: Each important page targets 1 primary keyword
  - Optimise page elements: Title tag (< 60 chars), meta description (< 160),
    H1, H2s, URL slug, image alt text, internal links
  - Content quality: 1500+ words for pillar pages, answer search intent fully
  - Page speed: < 3 seconds load time (use PageSpeed Insights)
  - Mobile-first: Responsive design, mobile-friendly test passing

  Off-page SEO:
  - Backlink strategy: Earn links through quality content, guest posting,
    PR, partnerships, and industry directories
  - Monitor backlink profile (Ahrefs, Moz): Disavow toxic links
  - Local SEO (if applicable): Google Business Profile, citations, reviews

  Technical SEO:
  - Submit XML sitemap to Google Search Console
  - Fix crawl errors, broken links, and redirect chains
  - Implement structured data (schema markup) for rich snippets

  - Monitor Core Web Vitals and resolve issues

STEP 2: SEM / PAID SEARCH (Google Ads)
  Campaign setup:
  - Define campaign objectives: Traffic, leads, sales, brand awareness
  - Structure: Campaign → Ad Group → Keywords → Ads
  - Keyword match types: Exact [keyword], Phrase "keyword", Broad keyword

  - Ad copy: Headline (30 chars x 3), Description (90 chars x 2), CTA

STEP 3: WEBSITE ANALYTICS & CRO

  - Set up funnels: Identify where users drop off in the conversion path
  - Monitor: Sessions, users, bounce rate, pages/session, conversion rate
  - Segment by: Source/medium, device, geography, landing page

  Conversion Rate Optimisation:
  - Identify high-traffic, low-conversion pages (opportunities)
  - A/B test: Headlines, CTAs, form length, page layout, trust signals
  - Heatmaps and session recordings (Hotjar, Crazy Egg) to understand behaviour
