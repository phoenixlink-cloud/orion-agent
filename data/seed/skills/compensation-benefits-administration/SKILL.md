DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: Ongoing (10-15 hours per month; intensive during annual review)

DESCRIPTION
Managing the organisation's compensation structure and employee benefits
programmes to attract, retain, and motivate talent. This covers salary
benchmarking, pay equity analysis, benefits administration, payroll inputs,
annual salary reviews, and ensuring regulatory compliance with tax and
benefits legislation.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: SALARY BENCHMARKING & STRUCTURE
  - Define job grades/levels aligned to the organisational hierarchy
  - Source market salary data from surveys (Mercer, Korn Ferry, PayScale, Glassdoor)
  - Build salary bands for each grade: Minimum, midpoint, maximum
  - Review annually against market movement and inflation (CPI)
  - Identify roles where pay is below market (retention risk)
  - Ensure internal equity: Similar roles at similar pay levels

STEP 2: ANNUAL SALARY REVIEW PROCESS
  Timeline (typical):
  - October: Budget approval for salary increases (% pool allocated)
  - November: Performance reviews completed with final ratings
  - December: Manager recommendations for individual increases
  - January: Calibration and approval by leadership
  - February: Communication to employees; effective date March 1

  Manager guidelines:
  - Distribute the increase pool based on performance ratings and market position
  - Higher increases for: Top performers, below-market pay, critical roles
  - Lower/zero increases for: Underperformers, above-market pay
  - Ensure no discriminatory patterns (gender, race, age pay gaps)

STEP 3: BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION
  Typical benefits portfolio:
  - Medical aid / health insurance: Enrolments, changes, terminations
  - Retirement fund / pension: Contributions, beneficiary nominations
  - Group life and disability insurance
  - Leave: Annual, sick, maternity/paternity, family responsibility
  - Employee Assistance Programme (EAP)
  - Study assistance / tuition reimbursement
  - Company car / travel allowance (where applicable)
  - Wellness programmes: Gym membership, health screenings

  Monthly tasks:
  - Process new enrolments and changes
  - Verify payroll deductions are correct
  - Handle employee queries about benefits
  - Reconcile benefits provider invoices

STEP 4: PAYROLL INPUTS & PROCESSING
  Monthly payroll cycle:
  - Collect and verify inputs: New hires, terminations, salary changes,
    overtime, commissions, bonuses, leave deductions, garnishees
  - Submit inputs to payroll by the cut-off date (typically 15th-20th)
  - Review payroll output before final processing:
    * Spot-check 10% of payslips for accuracy
    * Verify totals against previous month (flag variances > 5%)
    * Confirm statutory deductions (tax, UIF, pension) are correct
  - Approve payroll for payment
  - Handle post-payroll queries and corrections

STEP 5: PAY EQUITY ANALYSIS
  Conduct annually:
  - Extract salary data by role, grade, gender, race, tenure
  - Analyse pay gaps: Is there a statistically significant difference?
  - If gaps exist: Determine root cause (experience, performance, market?)
  - Propose corrective adjustments for unjustified gaps
  - Report findings to leadership and include in employment equity plan

STEP 6: COMPLIANCE & REPORTING
  - Ensure compliance with: Minimum wage, overtime regulations, tax withholding,
    benefits contribution requirements
  - Submit statutory returns: IRP5s (SA), W-2s (US), P60s (UK)
  - Prepare data for employment equity and BBBEE reporting
  - Maintain confidential compensation records in the HRIS
  - Respond to external salary surveys to maintain access to benchmarking data
