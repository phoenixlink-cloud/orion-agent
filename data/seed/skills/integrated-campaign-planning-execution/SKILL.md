SKILL ID:       MM-SK-001
ROLE:           Marketing Manager
CATEGORY:       Campaign Management
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 20-40 hours per campaign (planning through reporting)

DESCRIPTION
Designing, executing, and measuring integrated marketing campaigns across
multiple channels (digital, social, email, content, paid, events) to achieve
specific business objectives such as lead generation, brand awareness, or
product launch. This covers the full campaign lifecycle from strategy through
post-campaign analysis.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DEFINE CAMPAIGN OBJECTIVES
  - Business goal: What outcome does the campaign support?
    (Lead generation, brand awareness, product launch, event attendance)
  - SMART targets: "Generate 200 MQLs from mid-market SaaS companies in Q2
    at a cost per lead under R500"
  - Audience: Which buyer persona(s) are we targeting?
  - Key message: One clear value proposition that resonates with the audience
  - Success metrics: Primary KPI and 2-3 supporting metrics

STEP 2: DEVELOP THE CAMPAIGN STRATEGY
  Campaign brief document:
  - Campaign name and theme
  - Target audience and persona details
  - Key messaging and value proposition
  - Channels: Which mix of channels will reach this audience?
    * Owned: Website, blog, email, social media
    * Earned: PR, guest posts, reviews, word-of-mouth
    * Paid: Google Ads, social ads, display, sponsorships
  - Content requirements: What assets need to be created?
  - Timeline: Start date, key milestones, end date
  - Budget: Total and allocation by channel
  - Team: Who is responsible for what (RACI)

STEP 3: CREATE CAMPAIGN ASSETS
  Typical asset list:
  [ ] Landing page with conversion form
  [ ] Email sequence (3-5 emails: awareness, consideration, decision)
  [ ] Social media posts (platform-specific formats and copy)
  [ ] Blog post or article (SEO-optimised, 1500-2500 words)
  [ ] Lead magnet (whitepaper, ebook, template, checklist, webinar)
  [ ] Paid ad creative (display banners, social ad images/videos)
  [ ] Sales enablement materials (one-pager for sales follow-up)

  Creative process:
  - Brief the content team or agency with messaging, audience, and specs
  - Review drafts against brand guidelines and campaign objectives
  - A/B test headlines, CTAs, and creative where possible
  - Get final approval before launch

STEP 4: EXECUTE THE CAMPAIGN
  Launch checklist:
  [ ] Landing page live and tested (form works, tracking pixels installed)
  [ ] UTM parameters set for all links (source, medium, campaign, content)
  [ ] Email sequences scheduled and tested (preview in multiple clients)
  [ ] Social posts scheduled across platforms
  [ ] Paid ads launched with correct targeting and budgets
  [ ] CRM integration: Leads flow from form to CRM correctly
  [ ] Lead scoring and nurture workflows activated
  [ ] Sales team briefed on campaign and expected lead flow
  [ ] Analytics dashboard set up for real-time tracking

STEP 5: MONITOR AND OPTIMISE (During campaign)
  Daily/weekly monitoring:
  - Traffic: Landing page visits, bounce rate, time on page
  - Conversion: Form submissions, conversion rate, cost per conversion
  - Email: Open rate, click rate, unsubscribe rate
  - Social: Impressions, engagement, clicks, shares
  - Paid: CTR, CPC, CPA, ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)
  - Pipeline: MQLs generated, SQL conversion rate

  Optimisation actions:
  - Low conversion rate → Test new headlines, CTAs, or form length
  - High CPC → Refine targeting, test new ad creative, adjust bids
  - Low email opens → Test subject lines, send times, segmentation
  - Low engagement → Adjust messaging, try different content formats

STEP 6: POST-CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS
  Campaign report (within 1 week of campaign end):
  1. Objectives vs. results: Did we hit our targets?
  2. Channel performance: Which channels delivered the best ROI?
  3. Content performance: Which assets drove the most engagement?
  4. Lead quality: What % of MQLs converted to SQLs and opportunities?
  5. Budget: Actual spend vs. planned; cost per lead by channel
  6. Lessons learned: What worked, what didn't, what to do differently
  7. Recommendations: Suggestions for the next campaign
