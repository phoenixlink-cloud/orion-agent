SKILL: DATA PROTECTION & PRIVACY MANAGEMENT (GDPR/POPIA)

SKILL ID:       LC-SK-002
ROLE:           Legal Compliance Officer
CATEGORY:       Data Protection & Privacy
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 8-12 hours per week (ongoing)

DESCRIPTION
Managing the organisation's data protection and privacy compliance programme
under GDPR, POPIA, CCPA, or other applicable privacy legislation. This covers
data mapping, privacy impact assessments, data subject rights management,
breach notification, and ensuring privacy by design across all business processes.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DATA MAPPING & PROCESSING REGISTER
  Document all personal data processing activities:
  - What data: Categories of personal data collected (name, email, ID, financial, health)
  - Whose data: Data subjects (employees, customers, suppliers, website visitors)
  - Why: Legal basis for processing (consent, contract, legitimate interest, legal obligation)
  - How: Processing activities (collection, storage, analysis, sharing, deletion)
  - Where: Storage locations (databases, cloud, third parties, countries)
  - How long: Retention periods per data category
  - Who: Access controls (which roles/systems can access)
  - Third parties: Data processors and sub-processors with contracts in place

  Maintain the register in a central system (OneTrust, spreadsheet, or GRC platform)
  Review and update quarterly or when processing activities change.

STEP 2: PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENTS (DPIAs/PIAs)
  Required when:
  - Launching a new product, service, or system that processes personal data
  - Changing how existing personal data is processed
  - Processing special category data (health, biometrics, children)
  - Large-scale profiling or automated decision-making
  - Sharing data with new third parties or across borders

  DPIA process:
  1. Describe the processing: What, why, how, and who
  2. Assess necessity and proportionality: Is this the minimum data needed?
  3. Identify risks to data subjects: Unauthorised access, data loss, misuse
  4. Assess likelihood and severity of each risk
  5. Identify controls and mitigations: Encryption, access controls, minimisation
  6. Document residual risk and decision: Accept, mitigate further, or abandon
  7. Sign-off by DPO/Compliance Officer before processing begins

STEP 3: DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS MANAGEMENT
  Handle requests within statutory timeframes (typically 30 days):

  RIGHT OF ACCESS (DSAR):
  - Verify identity of the requester
  - Search all systems for the individual's personal data
  - Compile a response including: Data held, purposes, recipients, retention, rights
  - Redact third-party personal data before disclosure
  - Provide in a commonly used electronic format
  - Log and track all requests

  RIGHT TO ERASURE ("Right to be Forgotten"):
  - Assess whether erasure is required (check for overriding grounds)
  - Delete from all systems including backups (or mark for deletion at next backup cycle)
  - Notify third parties who received the data
  - Document the erasure and retain a record of the request

  RIGHT TO RECTIFICATION, PORTABILITY, OBJECTION:
  - Follow similar process: Verify, assess, action, document, respond

STEP 4: DATA BREACH MANAGEMENT
  Breach response procedure:
  1. DETECT: Identify the breach (employee report, monitoring alert, third-party notification)
  2. CONTAIN: Stop the breach, isolate affected systems, change passwords
  3. ASSESS: Determine scope (what data, how many subjects, risk level)
  4. NOTIFY REGULATOR: Within 72 hours (GDPR) or as required by local law
     Include: Nature of breach, categories of data, number of subjects affected,
     likely consequences, measures taken or proposed
  5. NOTIFY DATA SUBJECTS: If high risk to their rights and freedoms
     Include: What happened, what data was affected, what we're doing, what they can do
  6. REMEDIATE: Fix the root cause, strengthen controls
  7. DOCUMENT: Maintain a breach register with all details and outcomes
  8. LEARN: Update processes and training to prevent recurrence

STEP 5: THIRD-PARTY DATA PROCESSING AGREEMENTS
  For every third party that processes personal data on your behalf:
  - Execute a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with required clauses:
    * Subject matter and duration of processing
    * Nature and purpose of processing
    * Types of personal data and categories of data subjects
    * Obligations and rights of the controller
    * Security measures required
    * Sub-processor management and approval
    * Data breach notification obligations
    * Audit rights
    * Data return/deletion on termination
  - Conduct due diligence on the processor's security and compliance
  - Review DPAs annually and when processing changes
  - For international transfers: Ensure adequate safeguards (SCCs, adequacy decisions)
