SKILL ID:       REC-SK-001
ROLE:           Receptionist / Front Desk Coordinator
CATEGORY:       Communications
DIFFICULTY:     Intermediate
ESTIMATED TIME: Ongoing (continuous throughout workday)

DESCRIPTION
The ability to professionally manage a high-volume, multi-line telephone system
including answering, screening, transferring, and routing calls efficiently
while maintaining a courteous and professional tone. This skill covers standard
greetings, hold procedures, message-taking, voicemail management, and
escalation protocols for urgent or sensitive calls.

OBJECTIVES
1. Answer all incoming calls within 3 rings (< 10 seconds)
2. Use the correct standard greeting consistently on every call
3. Accurately screen and route calls to the appropriate person/department
4. Take complete, accurate messages when the intended recipient is unavailable
5. Manage hold times to under 60 seconds; check back with callers on hold
6. Handle difficult or irate callers with composure and professionalism
7. Maintain a call log for tracking and reporting purposes

STANDARD GREETING SCRIPT
INBOUND:
  "Good [morning/afternoon], [Company Name], [Your Name] speaking.
   How may I assist you?"

TRANSFER:
  "Certainly, let me transfer you to [Name/Department]. May I place you
   on a brief hold?"

HOLD CHECK-BACK:
  "Thank you for holding. [Name] is still on another call. Would you like
   to continue holding, or may I take a message?"

MESSAGE:
  "I'll make sure [Name] receives your message. May I confirm your name
   and the best number to reach you?"

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: ANSWER THE CALL
  - Pick up within 3 rings
  - Smile before speaking (affects vocal tone)
  - Deliver the standard greeting clearly and at moderate pace
  - Pay full attention to the caller's request

STEP 2: IDENTIFY THE CALLER'S NEED
  - Ask clarifying questions if the request is unclear
  - Determine: Who do they need? What department? Is it urgent?
  - If the caller is a known VIP/client, note their name and prioritise

STEP 3: SCREEN THE CALL (if required)
  - Ask: "May I ask who is calling?" and "May I ask what this is regarding?"
  - Check whether the intended recipient is available
  - If screening for executives, follow the executive screening protocol:
    * Never reveal the executive is "in a meeting" unless authorised
    * Default: "Let me check their availability for you"

STEP 4: TRANSFER OR TAKE A MESSAGE
  Option A — Transfer:
    - Inform the caller: "I'll transfer you now"
    - Announce the call to the recipient before connecting (warm transfer)
    - If recipient declines, return to caller and offer to take a message
  Option B — Message:
    - Record: Date, time, caller name, company, phone number, message, urgency
    - Read back the message to confirm accuracy
    - Deliver the message via email/note within 5 minutes

STEP 5: MANAGE HOLD QUEUE
  - Never leave a caller on hold for more than 60 seconds without checking back
  - If multiple lines are ringing, answer each and place on hold with apology
  - Prioritise: Emergency calls > Clients > Internal > Sales/solicitors

STEP 6: LOG THE CALL
  - Enter call details into the call log or CRM system
  - Flag any unresolved calls for follow-up
  - Note any complaints or escalations for management review

TOOLS & RESOURCES
- Multi-line phone system (PABX, VoIP, or cloud-based)
- Microsoft Teams / Zoom Phone (if applicable)
- Call log spreadsheet or CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Internal phone directory (digital or printed)
- Message pad / email templates for message delivery
- Headset (recommended for ergonomics and multitasking)

QUALITY STANDARDS
- Greeting consistency: 100% adherence to standard script
- Call answer rate: >= 95% within 3 rings
- Message accuracy: >= 98% (verified by read-back)
- Hold time: < 60 seconds average
- Caller satisfaction: >= 4.5/5.0 on internal surveys
- Zero dropped calls due to incorrect transfers

COMMON PITFALLS & HOW TO AVOID THEM
1. RUSHING THE GREETING
   Pitfall: Speaking too fast, mumbling, or skipping the company name
   Fix: Practise the greeting daily; smile before answering

2. COLD TRANSFERS
   Pitfall: Transferring without announcing the caller to the recipient
   Fix: Always do warm transfers — announce before connecting

3. FORGOTTEN HOLD CALLERS
   Pitfall: Leaving someone on hold indefinitely while handling other tasks
   Fix: Set a 45-second timer; check back proactively

4. INCOMPLETE MESSAGES
   Pitfall: Missing the callback number, misspelling names, or omitting urgency
   Fix: Use the message template; always read back to confirm

5. ARGUING WITH DIFFICULT CALLERS
   Pitfall: Becoming defensive or emotional with irate callers
   Fix: Use the HEAT method — Hear, Empathise, Apologise, Take action

BEST PRACTICES
- Keep a printed internal directory at your desk as backup
- Learn the names and voices of frequent callers (VIP recognition)
- Update the phone directory whenever staff changes occur
- Test the phone system at the start of each day (all lines working)
- Keep a glass of water at your desk to maintain clear vocal quality
- Stand up periodically — it energises your voice
