SKILL: REDDIT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT & CONTENT STRATEGY

SKILL ID:       SM-SK-002
ROLE:           Social Media Content Creator
CATEGORY:       Platform-Specific Content
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 1-2 hours daily (ongoing)

DESCRIPTION
Building brand presence and credibility on Reddit through authentic community
participation, value-first content, and strategic engagement across relevant
subreddits. Reddit is fundamentally different from other platforms — it
rewards genuine expertise and punishes self-promotion. This skill covers
subreddit research, karma building, content formatting, AMA coordination,
and navigating Reddit's unique culture and moderation landscape.

CRITICAL REDDIT PRINCIPLES
1. Reddit HATES obvious marketing and self-promotion
2. You must earn the right to promote by contributing value first
3. Every subreddit has its own rules, culture, and moderators — respect them
4. Authenticity and expertise are the currency of Reddit
5. Comments often outperform posts for building credibility
6. Reddit users are highly skeptical and will call out BS immediately
7. The community will do your marketing FOR you if you provide genuine value

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: SUBREDDIT RESEARCH & MAPPING
  Identify 10-20 subreddits where your target audience participates:
  - Use Reddit search, Google "site:reddit.com [topic]", and subreddit directories
  - Evaluate each subreddit:
    * Subscriber count (sweet spot: 10K-500K for meaningful engagement)
    * Activity level (posts per day, comments per post)
    * Relevance to your industry, product, or expertise
    * Moderation strictness (read rules carefully)
    * Self-promotion tolerance (some subs ban it entirely)
    * Competitor presence (are they active here?)

  Categorise subreddits:
  PRIMARY (daily engagement): 3-5 subs directly related to your industry
  SECONDARY (weekly engagement): 5-10 adjacent or complementary subs
  MONITORING (passive): Subs where brand mentions might appear

STEP 2: BUILD KARMA & CREDIBILITY (Weeks 1-8)
  Before any promotional activity, build your account's reputation:
  - Comment on 5-10 posts daily with genuinely helpful, insightful responses
  - Answer questions in your area of expertise with detailed, thorough replies
  - Share knowledge freely — Reddit rewards generosity
  - Upvote quality content from others (builds goodwill)
  - NEVER mention your brand or product during this phase
  - Target: 500+ comment karma before any promotional engagement

  What makes a great Reddit comment:
  - Directly answers the question or adds new information
  - Includes personal experience or expertise
  - Provides sources, data, or evidence when possible
  - Is well-formatted (bullet points, paragraphs, not walls of text)
  - Is respectful, even when disagreeing

STEP 3: CREATE VALUE-FIRST CONTENT
  Post types that work on Reddit:
  - EDUCATIONAL: "I've been a [professional] for 10 years. Here's what I wish
    I knew when I started" (detailed knowledge sharing)
  - DATA/RESEARCH: "I analysed 1,000 [things] and here's what I found"
    (original data always performs well)
  - GUIDE: "Complete beginner's guide to [topic]" (comprehensive, bookmark-worthy)
  - DISCUSSION: "What's your experience with [topic]?" (genuine curiosity)
  - AMA: "I'm a [role/expert in field]. Ask Me Anything" (with mod approval)
  - TOOL/RESOURCE: Sharing a genuinely useful free resource (not gated content)

  Post formatting for Reddit:
  - Title: Clear, specific, not clickbaity (Reddit users hate clickbait)
  - Body: Well-structured with headers, bullet points, and paragraphs
  - Length: Longer is often better on Reddit (detailed posts get saved/upvoted)
  - Include a TL;DR at the bottom for long posts
  - Flair your post correctly per subreddit rules

  Content to NEVER post on Reddit:
  - Blog links disguised as discussion ("Check out my article on...")
  - Thinly-veiled product promotions
  - Generic content copied from other platforms
  - Anything that feels like an ad
  - Posts that violate subreddit rules (even slightly)

STEP 4: STRATEGIC BRAND INTEGRATION (After establishing credibility)
  The 10:1 Rule: For every 1 post that mentions your brand, make 10 posts
  that are purely helpful with no brand mention.

  Acceptable brand mentions:
  - When someone asks for a recommendation and your product genuinely fits
    (disclose your affiliation: "Full disclosure, I work for [Company]")
  - In your user flair (many subs allow professional titles)
  - In AMAs where the context is transparent
  - When sharing genuinely useful tools you've built (with full transparency)

  ALWAYS disclose your affiliation — Reddit communities respect honesty
  and will destroy your reputation if they discover undisclosed marketing.

STEP 5: COORDINATE AMAs (Ask Me Anything)
  Planning (2-4 weeks before):
  - Contact subreddit moderators to propose the AMA and get approval
  - Choose the right subreddit (industry-specific subs, not just r/IAmA)
  - Promote the AMA date across your other channels
  - Prepare 5-10 anticipated questions with draft answers
  - Brief the participant (if it's an executive or expert, not yourself)

  During the AMA (2-3 hours):
  - Post the AMA with a compelling introduction (who you are, why this matters)
  - Include proof of identity (photo, company verification)
  - Answer questions thoroughly — long, detailed answers are expected
  - Be honest about what you don't know
  - Stay for at least 2 hours; come back to answer late questions
  - Upvote good questions (even tough ones)

  After the AMA:
  - Thank the community and moderators
  - Follow up on any unanswered questions within 24 hours
  - Share the AMA link on other platforms
  - Analyse: What questions came up most? What surprised you?

STEP 6: MONITOR & RESPOND TO BRAND MENTIONS
  Set up monitoring for:
  - Brand name mentions (including misspellings)
  - Product name mentions
  - Competitor mentions (for competitive intelligence)
  - Industry keywords (for relevant conversations)

  Response protocol:
  - Positive mention: Thank them, ask follow-up questions, amplify
  - Neutral/question: Provide helpful information (disclose affiliation)
  - Negative mention: Acknowledge, apologise if warranted, offer to help
    via DM. NEVER argue or get defensive on Reddit — you will lose.
  - Misinformation: Politely correct with facts and sources
