SKILL: COMMUNITY CRISIS MANAGEMENT & BRAND REPUTATION

SKILL ID:       SM-SK-005
ROLE:           Social Media Content Creator
CATEGORY:       Crisis Management & Reputation
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: Variable (immediate response required during crises)

DESCRIPTION
Managing negative situations, viral criticism, PR crises, and reputation
threats across social media platforms. This skill covers monitoring for
potential issues, escalation protocols, response frameworks, and recovery
strategies to protect and restore brand reputation during and after a crisis.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: MONITOR FOR EARLY WARNING SIGNS
  Set up alerts for:
  - Brand name mentions (including misspellings and abbreviations)
  - Product/service names
  - Executive names
  - Industry crisis keywords
  - Competitor crises (may spill over to your brand)
  - Unusual spikes in mentions, comments, or negative sentiment

  Warning signs:
  - Sudden increase in negative comments on a post
  - Viral negative tweet or Reddit thread about your brand
  - Customer complaint gaining traction (retweets, upvotes, media pickup)
  - Employee or former employee making public allegations
  - Leaked internal information appearing on social media
  - Competitor attack or comparison going viral

STEP 2: ASSESS SEVERITY
  LEVEL 1 — MINOR: Individual complaint, low visibility
    Response: Standard customer service response, resolve directly
    Timeframe: Within 2 hours
    Escalation: None needed

  LEVEL 2 — MODERATE: Multiple complaints, growing visibility, media interest
    Response: Acknowledge, investigate, provide updates
    Timeframe: Within 1 hour
    Escalation: Marketing Manager and relevant department head

  LEVEL 3 — MAJOR: Viral negative content, media coverage, potential legal/regulatory
    Response: Hold all scheduled posts, convene crisis team, prepare statement
    Timeframe: Within 30 minutes (initial acknowledgement)
    Escalation: CEO, Legal, PR, Marketing Manager

STEP 3: IMMEDIATE RESPONSE (For Level 2-3)
  DO:
  - Acknowledge the issue quickly: "We're aware of [issue] and are looking into it"
  - Show empathy: "We understand your concern and take this seriously"
  - Commit to transparency: "We'll share more information as soon as we have it"
  - Pause scheduled content (it looks tone-deaf during a crisis)
  - Designate a single spokesperson (consistency is crucial)
  - Document everything (screenshots, timestamps, responses)

  DO NOT:
  - Delete negative comments (unless they're abusive or threatening)
  - Argue or get defensive
  - Make promises you can't keep
  - Use humour or deflection
  - Ignore the issue hoping it goes away
  - Let multiple people respond with different messages
  - Post unrelated content while the crisis is active

STEP 4: CRAFT THE OFFICIAL RESPONSE
  Crisis response framework:
  1. ACKNOWLEDGE: "We are aware of [specific issue]"
  2. EMPATHISE: "We understand the concern/frustration this has caused"
  3. EXPLAIN: Brief, factual explanation (if known). If investigating: say so
  4. ACT: "We are taking the following steps: [specific actions]"
  5. COMMIT: "We will provide an update by [specific time]"
  6. CONTACT: "For individual concerns, please reach us at [channel]"

  Platform-specific posting:
  - X: Pin the response to the top of the profile
  - Reddit: Post a transparent, detailed response in the relevant thread
  - Instagram: Story + post for visibility
  - LinkedIn: Professional statement (especially for B2B/corporate issues)
  - ALL: Link to a detailed statement on your website if needed

STEP 5: MANAGE ONGOING COMMUNICATION
  - Provide regular updates at promised intervals
  - Respond individually to legitimate concerns
  - Do not engage with trolls (they want a reaction, not a resolution)
  - Redirect conversations to DM/email for individual case resolution
  - Keep the crisis team updated on social media sentiment in real-time
  - Monitor for new developments or escalation

STEP 6: POST-CRISIS RECOVERY
  Within 1 week of resolution:
  - Publish a final update: What happened, what was done, what changed
  - Thank the community for their patience and feedback
  - Implement any promised changes and communicate progress
  - Gradually resume normal content posting

  Within 1 month:
  - Conduct a crisis post-mortem: What triggered it? How did we respond?
    What worked? What didn't? What will we do differently?
  - Update the crisis communication plan based on learnings
  - Monitor sentiment to confirm recovery
  - Rebuild trust through consistent, valuable content
