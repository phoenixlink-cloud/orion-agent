SKILL: PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT CYCLE ADMINISTRATION

SKILL ID:       HR-SK-003
ROLE:           HR Manager
CATEGORY:       Performance & Development
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 40-60 hours per review cycle (organisation-wide)

DESCRIPTION
Designing, implementing, and administering the organisation's performance
management system covering goal-setting, continuous feedback, mid-year reviews,
annual appraisals, calibration, and linking outcomes to compensation and
development. This skill ensures fair, consistent, and motivating performance
evaluation across all departments.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: GOAL-SETTING (Q1 — January/February)
  - Cascade organisational objectives to departmental and individual goals
  - Train managers on writing SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable,
    Relevant, Time-bound)
  - Each employee sets 4-6 goals with their manager, covering:
    * Business deliverables (what you achieve)
    * Behavioural competencies (how you achieve it)
    * Development objectives (how you grow)
  - Document goals in the HRIS/performance system
  - Deadline: All goals captured by end of February

STEP 2: CONTINUOUS FEEDBACK & CHECK-INS (Ongoing)
  - Encourage monthly 1:1 meetings between managers and direct reports
  - Provide managers with conversation guides and coaching frameworks
  - Track check-in completion rates in the HRIS
  - Address performance issues early — do not wait for the annual review
  - Document significant achievements and concerns throughout the year

STEP 3: MID-YEAR REVIEW (Q2/Q3 — June/July)
  - Send reminders to all managers and employees 2 weeks before deadline
  - Employees complete self-assessments
  - Managers complete mid-year evaluations with progress ratings
  - Conduct calibration discussions within departments to ensure fairness
  - Identify at-risk performers for Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs)
  - Adjust goals if business priorities have changed

STEP 4: ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW (Q4 — November/December)
  - Send the annual review timeline and instructions to all staff
  - Employees complete comprehensive self-assessments
  - Managers complete annual evaluations with final ratings
  - Rating scale (example):
    5 = Exceptional: Consistently exceeds all expectations
    4 = Exceeds: Frequently exceeds expectations
    3 = Meets: Consistently meets expectations
    2 = Below: Sometimes falls short of expectations
    1 = Unsatisfactory: Consistently fails to meet expectations
  - Conduct formal review conversations (manager + employee, 45-60 min)
  - Document the discussion, agreed ratings, and development plan

STEP 5: CALIBRATION (Post-review)
  - Facilitate cross-departmental calibration sessions with leadership
  - Ensure rating distribution is fair and consistent (no inflated ratings)
  - Review: Are high performers being recognised? Are issues being addressed?
  - Expected distribution (guideline, not forced):
    5: ~5%, 4: ~20%, 3: ~55%, 2: ~15%, 1: ~5%
  - Adjust ratings where justified based on calibration discussion

STEP 6: OUTCOMES & FOLLOW-THROUGH
  - Link ratings to: Salary increases, bonuses, promotions, development plans
  - Communicate salary review outcomes in January
  - Initiate PIPs for employees rated 1-2 (with manager support)
  - Identify high-potentials for accelerated development programmes
  - Archive all review documentation in the HRIS
