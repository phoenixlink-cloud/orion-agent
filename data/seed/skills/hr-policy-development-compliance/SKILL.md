SKILL: HR POLICY DEVELOPMENT & LABOUR LAW COMPLIANCE

SKILL ID:       HR-SK-005
ROLE:           HR Manager
CATEGORY:       Governance & Compliance
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 8-16 hours per policy; ongoing compliance monitoring

DESCRIPTION
Developing, maintaining, and enforcing HR policies that comply with applicable
labour legislation while supporting the organisation's culture and operational
needs. This covers policy creation, legal review, employee communication,
compliance monitoring, and statutory reporting obligations.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: IDENTIFY POLICY NEEDS
  Triggers for new or updated policies:
  - Legislative changes (new laws or amendments)
  - Organisational changes (restructuring, new benefits, remote work)
  - Recurring employee issues that lack clear guidance
  - Audit findings or compliance gaps
  - Industry best practice developments

STEP 2: RESEARCH & DRAFT
  - Review applicable legislation and regulatory requirements
  - Benchmark against industry peers and best practice standards
  - Draft the policy using the standard template:
    * Policy title and reference number
    * Purpose and scope
    * Definitions
    * Policy statement and rules
    * Procedures and processes
    * Roles and responsibilities
    * Exceptions and escalation
    * Related policies and references
    * Version history and approval
  - Use clear, plain language — avoid legal jargon where possible
  - Ensure the policy is practical and enforceable

STEP 3: LEGAL REVIEW & APPROVAL
  - Submit to legal counsel for compliance review
  - Consult with employee representatives or unions (if applicable)
  - Present to the leadership team for feedback and approval
  - Obtain formal sign-off from the authorising executive

STEP 4: COMMUNICATE & IMPLEMENT
  - Announce the policy via email, intranet, and team meetings
  - Conduct training sessions for managers on policy application
  - Update the employee handbook
  - Require employee acknowledgement (digital sign-off)
  - Publish on the company intranet / shared drive

STEP 5: MONITOR COMPLIANCE
  - Track policy adherence through audits and spot-checks
  - Investigate reported violations through the disciplinary process
  - Collect feedback from managers and employees on practical challenges
  - Review policy effectiveness annually — is it achieving its purpose?

STEP 6: STATUTORY REPORTING
  Maintain compliance with mandatory reporting:
  - Employment equity reports and plans
  - BBBEE scorecards and verification
  - Workplace injury and incident reports (COIDA/OSHA)
  - Annual tax certificates and returns
  - Leave and overtime records (per BCEA/FLSA requirements)
  - Data protection compliance (POPIA/GDPR employee data handling)
