SKILL: CRISIS LEADERSHIP & DECISIVE DECISION-MAKING

SKILL ID:       CEO-SK-005
ROLE:           Chief Executive Officer
CATEGORY:       Crisis Management & Decision-Making
DIFFICULTY:     Expert
ESTIMATED TIME: Variable (immediate response required during crises)

DESCRIPTION
Leading the organisation through crises — economic downturns, PR disasters,
operational failures, competitive threats, pandemics, or existential threats —
with calm, decisive leadership that protects the organisation's people, assets,
reputation, and long-term viability. This skill also covers the CEO's daily
practice of making high-stakes decisions under uncertainty and incomplete
information.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: CRISIS DETECTION AND ASSESSMENT
  Types of crises a CEO must be prepared for:
  - FINANCIAL: Cash crunch, loss of major customer, market downturn, fraud
  - OPERATIONAL: System failure, supply chain disruption, safety incident
  - REPUTATIONAL: Media scandal, social media crisis, executive misconduct
  - LEGAL/REGULATORY: Lawsuit, regulatory investigation, compliance failure
  - COMPETITIVE: Disruptive competitor, technology shift, market obsolescence
  - PEOPLE: Key person departure, labour action, workplace tragedy
  - EXTERNAL: Pandemic, natural disaster, geopolitical event, cyber attack

  Assessment framework (within first 60 minutes):
  - WHAT happened? (Facts only — no speculation)
  - WHO is affected? (Employees, customers, shareholders, public)
  - HOW BAD is it? (Containable / Serious / Existential)
  - WHAT'S THE TRAJECTORY? (Getting worse, stable, or improving)
  - WHAT CAN WE DO RIGHT NOW? (Immediate containment actions)

STEP 2: ACTIVATE CRISIS RESPONSE
  Within the first 2 hours:
  1. ASSEMBLE the crisis team: Relevant C-suite, Legal, Communications, and subject
     matter experts
  2. CONTAIN the damage: What can be done immediately to stop it getting worse?
  3. ESTABLISH facts: What do we know for certain? What is speculation?
  4. COMMUNICATE internally: Brief the executive team and affected employees first
  5. COMMUNICATE externally: If necessary, issue a holding statement:
     "We are aware of [situation], are taking it seriously, and will provide
     an update by [time]"
  6. ASSIGN ROLES: Incident commander, communications lead, legal lead, operations lead
  7. SET RHYTHM: Establish update cadence (hourly during acute phase)

STEP 3: LEAD THROUGH THE CRISIS
  The CEO's role during a crisis:
  - BE VISIBLE: Employees, customers, and stakeholders need to see their leader
  - BE CALM: Your emotional state sets the tone for the entire organisation
  - BE HONEST: Share what you know, what you don't, and what you're doing
  - BE DECISIVE: Make the best decision you can with available information
    (80% confidence is enough — waiting for 100% costs more than being 80% right)
  - BE COMPASSIONATE: If people are affected, lead with empathy first
  - BE ACCOUNTABLE: "The buck stops here" — take responsibility publicly

  Decision-making under crisis pressure:
  - Gather the best information available (you'll never have all of it)
  - Consult your crisis team for input (but the decision is yours)
  - Consider: What's the worst case if we act? What's the worst case if we don't?
  - Decide, communicate, and execute — then adjust as new information arrives
  - Avoid analysis paralysis: A good decision now beats a perfect decision too late

STEP 4: COMMUNICATE DURING CRISIS
  Internal communication:
  - All-hands message within hours (email + video if possible)
  - Acknowledge the situation, share what's known, explain what's being done
  - Tell employees what they should do (and what they shouldn't)
  - Provide a channel for questions and concerns
  - Update regularly (daily during active crisis)

  External communication:
  - Work with PR/Communications to craft messaging
  - Designate a single spokesperson (usually CEO for major crises)
  - Key messages: Facts, empathy, action, commitment
  - Avoid: Blame, speculation, minimisation, defensiveness
  - Legal review all public statements (but don't let legal paralyse you)
  - Monitor media and social media; respond to misinformation quickly

  Board communication:
  - Brief the Chair immediately (within first hour for major crises)
  - Provide daily updates during the acute phase
  - Formal board briefing as soon as practical
  - Seek Board guidance on decisions above CEO authority

STEP 5: RECOVER AND REBUILD
  When the acute phase ends:
  - Conduct a thorough post-incident review (within 2 weeks)
  - Root cause analysis: What caused this? What made it worse?
  - What went well in our response? What should we improve?
  - Update crisis response plans based on learnings
  - Implement systemic changes to prevent recurrence
  - Communicate outcomes to all stakeholders
  - Recognise the crisis team's efforts
  - Monitor for lasting impacts (employee morale, customer confidence, reputation)

STEP 6: DAILY DECISION-MAKING DISCIPLINE (Non-crisis)
  The CEO makes dozens of decisions daily — most under uncertainty:
  
  Decision framework:
  - REVERSIBLE decisions (two-way door): Decide quickly, adjust if wrong
    (Most operational decisions — product features, hiring, small investments)
  - IRREVERSIBLE decisions (one-way door): Decide carefully with full analysis
    (M&A, major strategy shifts, leadership changes, market exits)

  Rules:
  - Set a time limit for every decision (don't let decisions linger)
  - Seek diverse perspectives (avoid echo chambers and groupthink)
  - Separate signal from noise (focus on what matters, ignore what doesn't)
  - Accept that some decisions will be wrong — learn and adjust
  - Delegate: Not every decision needs the CEO — push decisions down
  - The worst decision is usually no decision at all

  Daily rhythm:
  - Morning: Review key metrics, overnight developments, and priorities
  - Day: Strategic meetings, stakeholder engagement, decision-making
  - Evening: Reflect on today's decisions, prepare for tomorrow
  - Weekly: Step back from operations; think about the long term
