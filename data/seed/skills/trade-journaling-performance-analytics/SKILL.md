SKILL: TRADE JOURNALING & PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS

SKILL ID:       FX-SK-005
ROLE:           Professional Forex Trader
CATEGORY:       Performance & Review
DIFFICULTY:     Intermediate to Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 15-30 min daily; 2-3 hours weekly/monthly review

DESCRIPTION
Maintaining a comprehensive trading journal and analysing performance data to
identify strengths, weaknesses, and patterns in your trading. This skill turns
raw trade data into actionable insights that drive continuous improvement and
strategy refinement. The journal is the trader's most important tool for
long-term profitability.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: LOG EVERY TRADE (Immediately after entry)
  For each trade, record:
  - Date and time of entry
  - Currency pair
  - Direction: Long or Short
  - Entry price
  - Stop-loss price and distance (pips)
  - Take-profit price(s) and distance (pips)
  - Position size (lots)
  - Risk amount ($ and % of account)
  - Risk-reward ratio at entry
  - Setup type: Which strategy/pattern triggered the trade?
  - Timeframe: Which chart timeframe was used for entry?
  - Screenshot: Chart at the time of entry with levels marked
  - Rationale: 2-3 sentences on WHY you took this trade
  - Confidence level: 1-5 (how confident are you in this setup?)
  - Emotional state: Calm, anxious, excited, bored, frustrated

STEP 2: LOG TRADE OUTCOME (After exit)
  - Exit date and time
  - Exit price
  - P&L in pips and dollars
  - Result: Win, Loss, or Breakeven
  - Actual risk-reward achieved
  - Screenshot: Chart at exit showing the full trade
  - What happened: Brief narrative of how the trade played out
  - Plan compliance: Did I follow the trading plan? (Yes/No — be honest)
  - If No: What rule did I break and why?
  - Lesson learned: One takeaway from this trade
  - Would I take this trade again? (Yes/No)

STEP 3: WEEKLY PERFORMANCE REVIEW (Every Sunday, 1 hour)
  Review all trades from the past week:
  1. Total trades taken: How many? (Too many = overtrading? Too few = fear?)
  2. Win/Loss ratio: Wins vs. losses this week
  3. Net P&L: Total profit or loss in $ and %
  4. Average winner vs. average loser: Is your RR holding?
  5. Largest win and largest loss: Was the largest loss within risk limits?
  6. Plan compliance: What % of trades followed the plan?
  7. Best trade: What made it work? Can I replicate this?
  8. Worst trade: What went wrong? Was it the setup or my execution?
  9. Emotional patterns: When did emotions interfere with decisions?
  10. Action items: 1-2 specific things to improve next week

STEP 4: MONTHLY PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS
  Calculate key metrics:
  - Net return: Total P&L as % of starting equity
  - Win rate: Winning trades / Total trades
  - Average RR achieved: Average winner size / Average loser size
  - Expectancy: (Win% x Avg Win) - (Loss% x Avg Loss)
    Positive expectancy = profitable system over time
  - Profit factor: Gross profit / Gross loss (target > 1.5)
  - Sharpe ratio: (Average return - Risk-free rate) / Std deviation of returns
  - Maximum drawdown: Largest peak-to-trough decline this month
  - Recovery factor: Net profit / Maximum drawdown (target > 3.0)
  - Average hold time: How long are winning vs. losing trades held?

  Segmented analysis:
  - Performance by currency pair: Which pairs are most profitable?
  - Performance by session: London, NY, overlap — where do you perform best?
  - Performance by setup type: Which strategies generate the best returns?
  - Performance by day of week: Any patterns? (Many traders lose on Fridays)
  - Performance by confidence level: Do high-confidence trades actually win more?

STEP 5: IDENTIFY PATTERNS AND ADJUST
  Look for:
  - Winning patterns: "I perform best on EUR/USD during London session with
    pin bar entries at daily S/R levels" → Do more of this
  - Losing patterns: "I consistently lose on GBP/JPY during Asian session"
    → Stop trading this pair in this session
  - Emotional patterns: "I take revenge trades after 2+ consecutive losses"
    → Implement a mandatory 1-hour break after 2 losses
  - Timing patterns: "My best trades are taken between 8-11 AM"
    → Focus your energy on this window

  Strategy refinement:
  - If win rate is low but RR is good: Focus on entry quality
  - If win rate is good but RR is poor: Improve exit management (let winners run)
  - If both are poor: Re-examine your strategy fundamentals
  - If plan compliance is low: The issue is psychology, not strategy

STEP 6: MAINTAIN PERFORMANCE RECORDS
  Track over time:
  - Monthly equity curve (plot your account balance over time)
  - Rolling 3-month and 12-month returns
  - Drawdown chart (visualise drawdown depth and recovery)
  - Key metrics trend: Is win rate, RR, expectancy improving over time?
  - Compare to benchmarks: Are you beating a buy-and-hold index?
  - Annual review: Full-year performance report with strategy assessment
