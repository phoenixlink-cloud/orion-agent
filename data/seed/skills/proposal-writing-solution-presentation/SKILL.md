SKILL: PROPOSAL WRITING & SOLUTION PRESENTATION

SKILL ID:       SR-SK-003
ROLE:           Sales Representative
CATEGORY:       Communication & Persuasion
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 4-8 hours per proposal

DESCRIPTION
Creating tailored, compelling proposals and delivering persuasive solution
presentations that connect the prospect's specific business needs to your
offering. This covers proposal structure, ROI justification, competitive
differentiation, demo delivery, and handling objections during presentations.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: PROPOSAL PREPARATION
  Before writing, confirm you have:
  - Discovery notes: Pain points, desired outcomes, decision criteria
  - Stakeholder map: Who reads the proposal, who decides
  - Budget indication: Ballpark to ensure your pricing is in range
  - Competitive landscape: Who else are they evaluating?
  - Timeline: When do they need a decision?

STEP 2: STRUCTURE THE PROPOSAL
  Winning proposal format:
  1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1 page): Their problem, your solution, expected outcome
     - Mirror their language — use the words they used in discovery
     - Lead with their pain, not your product features
  2. UNDERSTANDING OF NEEDS: Demonstrate you heard them in discovery
  3. PROPOSED SOLUTION: How your offering addresses each need
     - Map features to their specific requirements
     - Include only relevant capabilities (don't feature-dump)
  4. IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH: Timeline, phases, milestones, resources
  5. INVESTMENT & ROI: Pricing with clear value justification
     - Show ROI: "Investment of R500K delivers R2M in annual savings"
     - Include total cost of ownership if relevant
  6. CASE STUDIES: 2-3 similar customers with measurable results
  7. TEAM: Key people who will work on their account
  8. TERMS & NEXT STEPS: Contract terms and path to signature

STEP 3: DELIVER THE PRESENTATION
  Presentation structure (30-45 min):
  - Opening (5 min): Recap their situation and confirm understanding
  - Solution (15 min): Demo or walkthrough tailored to their use case
  - Evidence (5 min): Case studies and ROI data
  - Investment (5 min): Pricing and commercial terms
  - Discussion (10 min): Questions, objections, next steps

  Demo best practices:
  - Show THEIR use case, not a generic demo
  - Focus on the 3-5 features that solve THEIR problems
  - Tell the story: "Imagine it's Monday morning, and [scenario]..."
  - Involve the audience: "How would your team typically handle this?"
  - End with a clear call to action

STEP 4: HANDLE OBJECTIONS
  Framework: LAER (Hear, Acknowledge, Explore, Respond)
  L - Hear them out fully without interrupting
  A - Acknowledge: "I understand your concern about..."
  E - Explore: "Can you help me understand what's driving that concern?"
  R - Respond: Address with evidence, case studies, or guarantees

  Common objections and responses:
  PRICE: "I understand budget is a consideration. Let me walk through the
    ROI — most customers see payback within [X] months."
  TIMING: "What would need to change for this to become a priority?"
  COMPETITOR: "That's a strong solution. Where we differ is [specific advantage]."
  RISK: "We offer [pilot/guarantee/phased rollout] to mitigate that risk."
  STATUS QUO: "The cost of doing nothing is [quantified impact per year]."

STEP 5: FOLLOW-UP AND CLOSE
  Within 24 hours:
  - Send proposal PDF with a personalised cover note
  - Reference specific points discussed in the meeting
  - Propose a concrete next step with a date
  After 3 business days:
  - Follow up: "Have you had a chance to review? Any questions?"
  After 7 business days:
  - Create urgency: Reference timeline, limited availability, or price validity
