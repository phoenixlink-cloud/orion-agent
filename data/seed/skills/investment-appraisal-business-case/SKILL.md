SKILL: INVESTMENT APPRAISAL & BUSINESS CASE DEVELOPMENT

SKILL ID:       FA-SK-004
ROLE:           Financial Analyst
CATEGORY:       Strategic Finance
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 16-40 hours per business case

DESCRIPTION
Evaluating proposed investments, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives
using rigorous financial analysis techniques to determine whether they create
shareholder value. This covers DCF valuation, NPV/IRR analysis, payback period
calculation, risk assessment, and the preparation of compelling business cases
for investment committee approval.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DEFINE THE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY
  - What is being proposed? (New product, acquisition, capex, market entry)
  - Strategic rationale: How does this align with company strategy?
  - Investment amount: Total cost and phasing over time
  - Expected benefits: Revenue uplift, cost savings, market share, strategic value
  - Time horizon: When do benefits start? How long do they last?
  - Alternatives: What are the other options (including "do nothing")?

STEP 2: BUILD THE FINANCIAL MODEL
  a) Revenue projections:
     - Market size x addressable share x capture rate x average revenue
     - Growth assumptions with supporting evidence
     - Ramp-up curve (typically conservative in Year 1-2)
  b) Cost projections:
     - Upfront investment: Capex, setup costs, integration costs
     - Ongoing costs: Opex, headcount, maintenance, marketing
     - One-off costs: Restructuring, redundancy, migration
  c) Cash flow projections:
     - Free Cash Flow = EBITDA - Tax - Capex - Working Capital changes
     - Project cash flows over the investment horizon
     - Include terminal value if appropriate

STEP 3: APPLY VALUATION TECHNIQUES
  PRIMARY: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
  - Determine the discount rate (WACC or project-specific hurdle rate)
  - Discount projected free cash flows to present value
  - Calculate terminal value (Gordon Growth or Exit Multiple method)
  - NPV = Sum of discounted cash flows - Initial investment
  - Decision rule: NPV > 0 = value-creating

  SUPPORTING METRICS:
  - IRR: Internal Rate of Return (discount rate that makes NPV = 0)
    * Decision rule: IRR > WACC = acceptable
  - Payback Period: Time to recover the initial investment
    * Simple payback and discounted payback
  - ROIC: Return on Invested Capital (annual return / capital invested)
  - Profitability Index: NPV / Initial Investment

STEP 4: SCENARIO & RISK ANALYSIS
  - Run base, upside, and downside scenarios
  - Sensitivity analysis on 3-5 key variables
  - Monte Carlo simulation for high-value investments (if tools available)
  - Identify key risks and assign probability and impact:
    * Market risk: Demand lower than expected
    * Execution risk: Delays, cost overruns
    * Competitive risk: Market response
    * Regulatory risk: Compliance requirements
    * Technology risk: Platform or product failure
  - Calculate risk-adjusted NPV where appropriate

STEP 5: PREPARE THE BUSINESS CASE DOCUMENT
  Structure:
  1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1 page): Recommendation, key numbers, strategic fit
  2. STRATEGIC CONTEXT: Why now? Market opportunity, competitive landscape
  3. PROPOSAL: What exactly is being proposed (scope, timeline, resources)
  4. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS: NPV, IRR, payback, scenarios, sensitivity
  5. RISKS & MITIGATIONS: Key risks with probability, impact, and mitigation
  6. ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED: Why this option vs. others
  7. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: Phases, milestones, resource requirements
  8. RECOMMENDATION: Clear yes/no/conditional recommendation
  9. APPENDIX: Detailed model, assumptions, supporting data

STEP 6: PRESENT TO INVESTMENT COMMITTEE
  - Lead with the recommendation (don't make them wait for the punchline)
  - Focus on the 3-5 numbers that matter: NPV, IRR, payback, key risk
  - Use visuals: Cash flow waterfall, sensitivity tornado, scenario comparison
  - Be prepared to defend every assumption
  - Address likely objections proactively
  - End with a clear ask: "We recommend approval of R[X]M for [Project]"

STEP 7: POST-INVESTMENT REVIEW (6-12 months after implementation)
  - Compare actual results to the business case projections
  - Document lessons learned: What assumptions were wrong? Why?
  - Calculate actual ROI and compare to projected ROI
  - Feed learnings into future business case assumptions

TOOLS & RESOURCES
- Excel (DCF model, sensitivity tables, scenario toggles)
- Financial databases (Bloomberg, Refinitiv, PitchBook for comparables)
- Business case template (company-standard format)
- WACC calculator (cost of equity via CAPM + cost of debt)
- Risk register template
- PowerPoint for investment committee presentation

QUALITY STANDARDS
- Model accuracy: Peer-reviewed, zero formula errors
- Assumptions: 100% documented with sources
- Scenario coverage: Minimum 3 scenarios (base, up, down)
- Sensitivity: Top 3-5 variables analysed
- Business case: Approved template, reviewed by finance leadership
- Post-investment review: Conducted within 12 months
