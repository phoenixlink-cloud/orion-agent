SKILL: C-SUITE CALENDAR & SCHEDULE OPTIMIZATION

SKILL ID:       EA-SK-001
ROLE:           Executive Assistant
CATEGORY:       Time Management & Planning
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: Ongoing (2-3 hours daily)

DESCRIPTION
Managing and optimising a C-suite executive's complex calendar spanning
multiple time zones, stakeholder groups, and competing priorities. This
includes proactive gatekeeping, conflict resolution, strategic time-blocking,
travel integration, and daily briefing preparation to ensure the executive's
time is allocated to the highest-value activities.

OBJECTIVES
1. Zero double-bookings or missed meetings
2. Maintain optimal meeting-to-focus-time ratio (60:40 or per exec preference)
3. Resolve scheduling conflicts within 30 minutes
4. Deliver daily briefing by 7:30 AM (or 30 min before first meeting)
5. Protect focus blocks and personal commitments from erosion
6. Seamlessly integrate travel days into the calendar

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE EXECUTIVE'S PRIORITIES
  Learn and maintain awareness of:
  - Strategic priorities this quarter (e.g., fundraising, product launch, M&A)
  - Standing commitments (board meetings, investor calls, leadership meetings)
  - Personal preferences: Morning person? Prefers no meetings before 9 AM?
  - Energy patterns: When do they do their best thinking? Protect that time.
  - Non-negotiables: Family time, exercise, travel buffer requirements

STEP 2: GATE-KEEP MEETING REQUESTS
  For every incoming request, evaluate:
  - WHO: Is this person a priority stakeholder? (Board > Investors > Direct reports > External)
  - WHAT: Does this align with current strategic priorities?
  - WHEN: Is the timing appropriate? Can it wait?
  - HOW LONG: Is the requested duration reasonable?

  Decision matrix:
  ACCEPT IMMEDIATELY: Board members, investors, critical business issues
  ACCEPT WITH SCHEDULING: Direct reports, key clients, strategic partners
  DEFER / DELEGATE: Routine updates (suggest a direct report instead)
  DECLINE POLITELY: Low-priority external requests, cold meeting requests

STEP 3: BUILD THE OPTIMAL WEEKLY SCHEDULE
  Template:
  MONDAY:    Internal meetings, leadership sync, week planning
  TUESDAY:   External meetings, client/partner calls
  WEDNESDAY: Focus time (AM), ad-hoc meetings (PM)
  THURSDAY:  External meetings, board prep, strategic work
  FRIDAY:    Direct report 1:1s, week review, flex time

  Rules:
  - Buffer 15 min between meetings (travel time, mental reset)
  - No more than 3 consecutive meetings without a break
  - Block lunch (even 30 min) — executives who skip lunch burn out
  - Block 2 hours of focus time per day minimum
  - Place travel days as all-day blocks with no meetings

STEP 4: PREPARE THE DAILY BRIEFING
  Deliver by 7:30 AM (or 30 min before first meeting):
  - Today's schedule: Time, meeting, attendees, location/link, purpose
  - Prep needed: "Read the attached brief before 10 AM call with [Name]"
  - Key decisions: What needs to be decided today?
  - Flagged items: Overdue action items, pending approvals, FYIs
  - Tomorrow preview: Major items to be aware of

STEP 5: MANAGE REAL-TIME CHANGES
  - Meeting running over: Notify next attendees of delay
  - Cancellation: Offer to fill the slot with deferred items or focus time
  - Urgent request: Assess priority, bump lowest-priority item if needed
  - Executive running late: Notify all affected parties proactively
  - Always have a "Plan B" for the day's schedule

STEP 6: TIME ZONE MANAGEMENT (for global executives)
  - Maintain a world clock widget for key time zones
  - When booking across zones: Always specify times in both zones
  - Respect "no meeting" hours in each time zone (e.g., no midnight calls)
  - Keep a cheat sheet of key contacts' time zones and working hours
  - Account for daylight saving time changes (update twice yearly)

TOOLS & RESOURCES
- Microsoft Outlook / Google Calendar (expert level)
- Scheduling tools: Calendly, Doodle (for external coordination)
- Time zone converter (worldtimebuddy.com)
- Daily briefing template (Word/Google Doc)
- Contact database with stakeholder priority rankings
- Travel itinerary integration (TripIt, Concur)

QUALITY STANDARDS
- Double-bookings: Zero
- Briefing delivery: 100% by 7:30 AM
- Conflict resolution: < 30 minutes
- Meeting-to-focus ratio: Within executive's preferred range
- Stakeholder satisfaction: Zero complaints about scheduling

BEST PRACTICES
- Learn the executive's rhythm — some think best at 6 AM, others at 10 PM
- Colour-code the calendar: Red=external, Blue=internal, Green=focus, Grey=travel
- Send weekly schedule summaries every Sunday evening
- Keep a running "deferred meetings" list — reschedule when slots open
- Anticipate seasonal patterns: Board cycles, earnings, budget season
- Never say "they're busy" — say "they're committed at that time, may I suggest..."
