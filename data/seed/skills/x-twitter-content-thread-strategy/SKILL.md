SKILL: X (TWITTER) CONTENT CREATION & THREAD STRATEGY

SKILL ID:       SM-SK-001
ROLE:           Social Media Content Creator
CATEGORY:       Platform-Specific Content
DIFFICULTY:     Intermediate to Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 2-3 hours daily (ongoing)

DESCRIPTION
Creating high-engagement content on X (formerly Twitter) including tweets,
threads, polls, quote tweets, and real-time commentary. This skill covers
the unique culture and algorithm of X, thread architecture, engagement
tactics, and building a loyal following through consistent, valuable content.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE X ALGORITHM & CULTURE
  Algorithm signals (what gets amplified):
  - Replies and conversations (highest weight)
  - Retweets and quote tweets
  - Likes
  - Time spent reading (dwell time)
  - Profile clicks from the tweet
  - Bookmark saves
  - Media engagement (image/video views)

  X culture rules:
  - Brevity is king — say it in fewer words
  - Hot takes and opinions drive engagement (but stay authentic)
  - Threads are the long-form content format of X
  - Authenticity beats polish — people follow people, not brands
  - Humour and wit are rewarded (when appropriate to brand)
  - Real-time relevance matters — comment on what's happening NOW
  - Don't be boring — X moves fast; you have 2 seconds to capture attention

STEP 2: DAILY CONTENT CADENCE
  Recommended posting schedule (3-5 posts/day):
  MORNING (7-9 AM): Insight or industry observation to start the day
  MIDDAY (11 AM-1 PM): Engagement post — question, poll, or hot take
  AFTERNOON (3-5 PM): Thread or detailed content piece
  EVENING (6-8 PM): Lighter content — reflection, behind-the-scenes, personal
  ANYTIME: React to trending topics or breaking news in your industry

  Content mix:
  40% — VALUE: Tips, insights, frameworks, how-tos
  25% — ENGAGEMENT: Questions, polls, debates, opinions
  20% — CONVERSATION: Replies, quote tweets, amplifying others
  10% — PROMOTION: Product mentions, launches, case studies
  5% — PERSONAL: Behind-the-scenes, team stories, culture

STEP 3: WRITE HIGH-PERFORMING TWEETS
  Tweet anatomy:
  - HOOK (first line): Must stop the scroll. Use a surprising stat, bold claim,
    or provocative question
  - BODY: The substance — keep it concise, use line breaks for readability
  - CTA: What should they do? Like, reply, follow, click, save, retweet

  Formats that work:
  - LISTICLE: "7 things I learned about [topic]:"
  - HOT TAKE: "Unpopular opinion: [contrarian view]"
  - FRAMEWORK: "The [X] framework for [outcome]:"
  - BEFORE/AFTER: "I used to [old way]. Now I [new way]. Here's why:"
  - QUESTION: "What's the one tool you can't live without for [area]?"
  - STORY: "3 years ago I [situation]. Here's what happened:"

  Writing tips:
  - Write at a Grade 8 reading level (simple, clear, direct)
  - Use numbers: "5 lessons" performs better than "some lessons"
  - Front-load the value — don't bury the lead
  - Use line breaks generously (walls of text don't get read)
  - Avoid jargon unless your audience expects it
  - End with a question to prompt replies

STEP 4: CREATE ENGAGING THREADS
  Thread structure (5-15 tweets):
  Tweet 1 (HOOK): "I spent 100 hours studying [topic]. Here are the 10
    biggest takeaways (a thread):"
  Tweets 2-9 (BODY): One key point per tweet, numbered
    - Start each tweet with the number or a strong first line
    - Include examples, data, or stories to support each point
    - Use images, charts, or screenshots where they add value
  Tweet 10 (SUMMARY): Recap the key takeaways in 3-4 bullets
  Tweet 11 (CTA): "If this was helpful: 1. Follow me for more [topic]
    2. Retweet the first tweet to share with your network"

  Thread tips:
  - Each tweet should stand alone (people often see individual tweets)
  - Number your tweets (1/10, 2/10) for scannability
  - Use images or charts in 2-3 tweets to break up text
  - Reply to your own thread with a "TLDR" for busy readers
  - Pin the thread to your profile for new followers to discover

STEP 5: ENGAGE AND BUILD COMMUNITY
  Daily engagement routine (30-60 min):
  - Reply to 10-15 tweets from people in your niche (genuine, thoughtful replies)
  - Quote tweet 2-3 interesting posts with your perspective added
  - Respond to every reply on your own tweets within 2 hours
  - DM new followers who fit your target audience (welcome, don't sell)
  - Participate in trending conversations relevant to your industry

  Engagement rules:
  - Never just say "Great post!" — add substance to every reply
  - Ask follow-up questions that show you read their content
  - Share your experience or a different perspective (creates dialogue)
  - Tag relevant people when sharing their work (builds relationships)
  - Thank people who retweet or share your content (builds loyalty)

STEP 6: TRACK AND OPTIMISE
  Weekly X analytics review:
  - Impressions per tweet (average and trend)
  - Engagement rate: (Likes + Replies + Retweets + Clicks) / Impressions
  - Top 5 performing tweets: What made them work?
  - Bottom 5: What fell flat? Why?
  - Follower growth: Net new followers this week
  - Profile visits: Trend (indicates brand interest)
  - Best posting times: When does your audience engage most?

  Monthly optimisation:
  - Double down on formats that work (more threads? More hot takes?)
  - Experiment with 1-2 new formats or topics
  - Review competitor accounts: What's working for them?
  - Adjust posting schedule based on engagement data
