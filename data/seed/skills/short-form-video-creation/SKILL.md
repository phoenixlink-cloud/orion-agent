SKILL: SHORT-FORM VIDEO CREATION (REELS, TIKTOK, SHORTS)

SKILL ID:       SM-SK-003
ROLE:           Social Media Content Creator
CATEGORY:       Video Content
DIFFICULTY:     Intermediate to Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 2-4 hours per video (concept to publish)

DESCRIPTION
Creating engaging short-form video content (15-90 seconds) for Instagram Reels,
TikTok, and YouTube Shorts. This skill covers concept ideation, scripting,
filming techniques, editing, trending audio/format usage, and platform-specific
optimisation to maximise reach and engagement.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: CONCEPT & IDEATION
  Content categories that perform well in short-form:
  - EDUCATIONAL: "3 things you didn't know about [topic]"
  - HOW-TO: Quick tutorial or tip demonstration
  - BEHIND-THE-SCENES: Show the human side of the brand
  - TRENDING: Participate in viral formats, sounds, or challenges
  - STORYTELLING: Mini-narratives with a hook, tension, and payoff
  - LISTICLES: "5 tools every [professional] needs"
  - MYTH-BUSTING: "Stop doing [common mistake]. Do this instead."
  - TRANSFORMATION: Before/after reveals

  Ideation sources:
  - TikTok Discover page and trending sounds
  - Instagram Reels tab (what's getting views in your niche)
  - YouTube Shorts trending page
  - Competitor accounts (what's working for them)
  - Customer questions and pain points
  - Industry news and developments
  - Comment sections (what are people asking about?)

STEP 2: SCRIPT & STORYBOARD
  Short-form video structure:
  HOOK (0-3 seconds): Stop the scroll. This is the most critical moment.
    - Start with a bold statement, question, or visual surprise
    - "Here's why you're losing money on [topic]..."
    - "Nobody talks about this, but..."
    - "The biggest mistake I see [professionals] make..."
  BODY (3-50 seconds): Deliver the value
    - Get to the point immediately — no long intros
    - One idea per video (don't cram multiple topics)
    - Use text overlays to reinforce spoken points
    - Show, don't just tell (demonstrate, use visuals, examples)
  PAYOFF (last 5-10 seconds): Satisfying conclusion + CTA
    - Deliver the punchline, reveal, or key takeaway
    - CTA: "Follow for more [topic]" or "Save this for later"
    - Loop point: Make the ending connect back to the beginning
      (this triggers rewatches which boost the algorithm)

STEP 3: FILMING
  Equipment (minimum viable):
  - Smartphone with good camera (iPhone 12+ or equivalent)
  - Ring light or natural window light (consistent, flattering)
  - Tripod or phone mount (stable footage)
  - Lapel microphone (clear audio is non-negotiable)

  Filming tips:
  - VERTICAL format (9:16 aspect ratio) — always
  - Good lighting > expensive camera
  - Clean, uncluttered background (or intentionally styled)
  - Look at the camera lens, not the screen (creates eye contact)
  - Speak with energy and pace — slightly faster than normal conversation
  - Film multiple takes — pick the best energy
  - Film B-roll footage for overlay during editing
  - Batch filming: Shoot 5-10 videos in one session (change outfits)

STEP 4: EDITING
  Editing principles:
  - Fast pace: Cut dead air, "ums", and pauses ruthlessly
  - Jump cuts: Keep energy high by cutting between sentences
  - Text overlays: Key points as text reinforces retention
  - Captions: 85% of social video is watched without sound — add subtitles
  - Music: Use trending audio (especially on TikTok and Reels)
  - Transitions: Smooth cuts, zoom effects, point-and-reveal
  - Colour grading: Consistent look across all videos (brand aesthetic)
  - Duration: Aim for the sweet spot per platform:
    TikTok: 15-60 seconds (shorter trending, longer educational)
    Reels: 15-30 seconds (algorithm favours completion rate)
    Shorts: 30-60 seconds (YouTube favours slightly longer)

  Editing tools:
  - Mobile: CapCut (best free option), InShot, VN Video Editor
  - Desktop: Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro
  - Captions: CapCut auto-captions, Descript, Zubtitle

STEP 5: OPTIMISE & PUBLISH
  Platform-specific optimisation:
  TikTok:
  - Use 3-5 relevant hashtags (mix of broad and niche)
  - Use trending sounds (check the Discover page)
  - Post at peak times: 7-9 AM, 12-3 PM, 7-11 PM (test for your audience)
  - Engage with comments in the first hour (signals to the algorithm)

  Instagram Reels:
  - Write a compelling caption (up to 2200 characters)
  - Use 5-10 hashtags (research with Hashtagify or Instagram search)
  - Share to Stories and feed for additional reach
  - Use original audio or trending Reels audio
  - Post at peak times: 9 AM, 12 PM, 5-7 PM (varies by audience)

  YouTube Shorts:
  - Title: Clear, keyword-rich (< 70 characters)
  - Add #Shorts in the title or description
  - Thumbnail: YouTube may auto-select; ensure the frame is compelling
  - Post consistently (daily if possible for Shorts algorithm)

STEP 6: ANALYSE & ITERATE
  Track per video:
  - Views / reach
  - Watch time and average view duration (completion rate)
  - Engagement: Likes, comments, shares, saves
  - Follower gain from this video
  - Click-throughs (if link in bio or CTA)

  Weekly analysis:
  - Top 3 performers: What hook, topic, format, and audio worked?
  - Bottom 3: Why did they underperform? (Weak hook? Wrong topic? Bad timing?)
  - Completion rate: Are people watching to the end?
  - Trending formats: What's new this week that you can adapt?

  Monthly content calendar update:
  - Double down on winning formats and topics
  - Retire underperforming content types
  - Plan 2-3 experiments with new formats
  - Refresh evergreen content with updated hooks
