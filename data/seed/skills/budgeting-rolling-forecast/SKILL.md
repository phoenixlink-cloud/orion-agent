SKILL: BUDGETING & ROLLING FORECAST MANAGEMENT

SKILL ID:       FA-SK-002
ROLE:           Financial Analyst
CATEGORY:       Planning & Forecasting
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 40-80 hours for annual budget; 8-12 hours per monthly forecast

DESCRIPTION
Leading the annual budget process and maintaining monthly rolling forecasts
that provide an always-current forward view of financial performance. This
covers budget construction, departmental coordination, consolidation,
variance tracking, and continuous reforecasting to keep leadership aligned
on expected outcomes.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS (Q3-Q4 for following year)
  Timeline:
  - Month 1: Issue budget guidelines, templates, and timeline to departments
  - Month 2: Departments submit bottom-up budgets; finance reviews
  - Month 3: Consolidation, challenge sessions, leadership approval

  Budget construction:
  a) Revenue budget: By product/service line, customer segment, geography
     - Base: Current run-rate adjusted for known wins/losses
     - Growth: New business pipeline, price increases, market expansion
  b) Cost budget: By department, cost centre, and line item
     - Headcount plan: Current + new hires, salary increases, benefits
     - Non-headcount: Rent, IT, marketing, travel, professional fees
     - Split fixed vs. variable for sensitivity modelling
  c) Capital budget: Planned investments, asset purchases, projects
  d) Cash flow budget: Operating, investing, financing activities

STEP 2: ROLLING FORECAST (Monthly)
  - Replace the earliest month with a new future month (always 12 months ahead)
  - Update actuals for the completed month
  - Reforecast remaining months based on:
    * Latest actuals and run-rate trends
    * Pipeline changes (won/lost deals, delayed projects)
    * Known cost changes (new hires, terminations, contract renewals)
    * Market conditions (FX rates, commodity prices, interest rates)
  - Highlight changes from prior forecast: What moved and why?
  - Present to leadership with commentary on risks and opportunities

STEP 3: VARIANCE ANALYSIS (Monthly)
  For each line item, analyse:
  - Actual vs. Budget: Did we hit the target?
  - Actual vs. Prior Forecast: Did our latest prediction hold?
  - Actual vs. Prior Year: Are we improving year-over-year?

  Decompose variances into drivers:
  - Volume variance: Sold more/fewer units than planned
  - Price variance: Average selling price higher/lower
  - Mix variance: Different product mix than planned
  - Cost variance: Spending more/less than budgeted
  - Timing variance: Revenue/cost recognised earlier/later
  - One-off items: Non-recurring items distorting the comparison

  Traffic light commentary:
  GREEN (< 5%):   On track, brief note
  AMBER (5-15%):  Monitor, explain root cause and outlook
  RED (> 15%):    Action required, present remediation plan

STEP 4: PRESENTATION TO LEADERSHIP
  Monthly finance review pack:
  1. Executive summary: One-page KPI dashboard
  2. P&L: Actual vs. budget vs. forecast vs. prior year
  3. Revenue deep-dive: By segment, product, geography
  4. Cost deep-dive: By department, fixed vs. variable
  5. Cash flow: Actual and forecast with commentary
  6. Key risks and opportunities: Quantified impact
  7. Updated full-year forecast with confidence range
