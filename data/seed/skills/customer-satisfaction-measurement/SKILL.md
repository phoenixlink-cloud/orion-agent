SKILL: CUSTOMER SATISFACTION MEASUREMENT (CSAT, NPS, CES)

SKILL ID:       CS-SK-004
ROLE:           Customer Service Manager
CATEGORY:       Analytics & Voice of Customer
DIFFICULTY:     Intermediate to Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 4-6 hours per week (ongoing)

DESCRIPTION
Designing, implementing, and analysing customer satisfaction measurement
programmes using industry-standard metrics (CSAT, NPS, CES) to quantify
service quality, identify improvement areas, and drive customer-centric
decision-making across the organisation.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: IMPLEMENT SURVEY PROGRAMMES
  CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score):
  - Question: "How satisfied were you with your experience?" (1-5 scale)
  - Trigger: Immediately after ticket resolution or interaction
  - Channel: Email, in-app, SMS, or IVR post-call survey
  - Calculation: (Satisfied responses [4-5] / Total responses) x 100
  - Target: >= 90%

  NPS (Net Promoter Score):
  - Question: "How likely are you to recommend us?" (0-10 scale)
  - Trigger: Quarterly or after key milestones (purchase, onboarding)
  - Follow-up: "What is the primary reason for your score?"
  - Calculation: % Promoters (9-10) minus % Detractors (0-6)
  - Target: >= 40 (varies by industry)

  CES (Customer Effort Score):
  - Question: "How easy was it to get your issue resolved?" (1-5 scale)
  - Trigger: After support interaction
  - Calculation: Average score (higher = easier = better)
  - Target: >= 4.0/5.0

STEP 2: ANALYSE RESULTS
  Weekly: Review CSAT scores, flag any below 3/5 for investigation
  Monthly: Full analysis including:
  - Score trends (improving, declining, stable?)
  - Score breakdown by: Channel, agent, issue type, customer segment
  - Verbatim analysis: Categorise open-text feedback into themes
  - Correlation analysis: What operational factors predict satisfaction?
  - Detractor follow-up: Have detractors been contacted and issues resolved?

STEP 3: VOICE OF CUSTOMER (VoC) REPORTING
  Monthly VoC report for leadership:
  1. Headline metrics: CSAT, NPS, CES with trends
  2. Top positive themes: What customers love (reinforce these)
  3. Top negative themes: What customers complain about (fix these)
  4. Verbatim highlights: Powerful quotes (both positive and negative)
  5. Improvement recommendations: Specific, actionable proposals
  6. Progress on previous recommendations: Status update

STEP 4: CLOSE THE LOOP
  With customers:
  - Contact every detractor (NPS 0-6) within 48 hours
  - Understand their specific issue and resolve it
  - Follow up to confirm satisfaction improvement
  With the organisation:
  - Share insights with product, sales, and operations teams
  - Track improvement initiatives through to implementation
  - Measure the impact of changes on subsequent scores
