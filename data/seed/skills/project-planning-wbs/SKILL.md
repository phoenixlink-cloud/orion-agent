SKILL: PROJECT PLANNING & WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE

SKILL ID:       PM-SK-001
ROLE:           Project Manager
CATEGORY:       Planning & Scheduling
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 16-40 hours per project plan

DESCRIPTION
Creating comprehensive project plans including scope definition, Work Breakdown
Structure (WBS), schedule development with critical path analysis, resource
allocation, and milestone tracking. This is the foundational planning skill
that determines whether a project will be delivered on time and within scope.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DEFINE PROJECT SCOPE
  - Document what IS in scope and what IS NOT (scope boundary)
  - Define deliverables: Tangible outputs the project will produce
  - Define success criteria: How will we know the project succeeded?
  - Get sponsor sign-off on the scope statement

STEP 2: CREATE THE WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE (WBS)
  Decompose the project into manageable work packages:
  Level 1: Project name
  Level 2: Major phases or workstreams
  Level 3: Deliverables within each phase
  Level 4: Work packages (smallest unit of assignable work)

  Rules:
  - 100% rule: WBS must capture 100% of project scope
  - Each work package should be 8-80 hours of effort
  - Work packages must have a single owner
  - Use noun phrases (deliverables), not verb phrases (activities)

STEP 3: ESTIMATE EFFORT AND DURATION
  For each work package:
  - Effort: How many person-hours/days to complete?
  - Duration: How many calendar days (accounting for availability)?
  - Use three-point estimation for uncertain work:
    Estimate = (Optimistic + 4*Most_Likely + Pessimistic) / 6
  - Document estimation assumptions and basis of estimate

STEP 4: SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES AND IDENTIFY DEPENDENCIES
  Dependency types:
  - Finish-to-Start (FS): Task B cannot start until Task A finishes
  - Start-to-Start (SS): Task B starts when Task A starts
  - Finish-to-Finish (FF): Task B finishes when Task A finishes
  - Start-to-Finish (SF): Rare — Task B cannot finish until Task A starts

  Identify the CRITICAL PATH:
  - The longest sequence of dependent tasks through the project
  - Any delay on the critical path delays the entire project
  - Focus management attention on critical path activities
  - Identify near-critical paths (< 5 days of float) as risk areas

STEP 5: ASSIGN RESOURCES
  - Map required skills to available team members
  - Check resource availability (other projects, leave, capacity)
  - Level resources: Ensure no one is over-allocated (> 100%)
  - Identify resource constraints and plan accordingly
  - Build the RACI matrix: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed

STEP 6: SET MILESTONES AND BASELINES
  - Define key milestones (decision points, phase gates, deliverables)
  - Set the project baseline: Approved scope, schedule, and budget
  - All future tracking is measured against this baseline
  - Baseline can only change through formal change control

STEP 7: BUILD THE GANTT CHART
  - Enter all tasks, durations, dependencies, and resources
  - Highlight the critical path
  - Mark milestones as diamond shapes
  - Add buffer/contingency time (typically 10-15% of total duration)
  - Review with the team for feasibility and buy-in

TOOLS & RESOURCES
- Microsoft Project / Smartsheet / Monday.com
- WBS template (org chart or indented list format)
- Gantt chart tool
- RACI matrix template
- Estimation spreadsheet (three-point estimation)
- Resource calendar (team availability)
- Critical path analysis tool

QUALITY STANDARDS
- WBS: 100% scope coverage, no gaps
- Estimates: Three-point for uncertain tasks, basis documented
- Dependencies: All logical relationships captured
- Critical path: Identified and highlighted
- Resource levelling: No over-allocation > 100%
- Baseline: Set and approved by sponsor
- Plan review: Validated by project team before baseline
