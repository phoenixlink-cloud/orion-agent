SKILL: CRM MANAGEMENT & SALES FORECASTING

SKILL ID:       SR-SK-005
ROLE:           Sales Representative
CATEGORY:       Operations & Analytics
DIFFICULTY:     Intermediate
ESTIMATED TIME: 3-5 hours per week (ongoing)

DESCRIPTION
Maintaining accurate CRM data and producing reliable sales forecasts that
enable management to make informed resource, hiring, and financial decisions.
This covers deal tracking, pipeline management, forecasting methodology,
and the discipline of consistent CRM hygiene.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DAILY CRM DISCIPLINE
  After every prospect interaction:
  - Log the activity (call, email, meeting) with date and summary
  - Update deal stage if progress was made
  - Record next action and follow-up date
  - Note any new stakeholders, competitors, or buying signals
  Time investment: 10-15 minutes per day (non-negotiable habit)

STEP 2: WEEKLY PIPELINE REVIEW
  Every Friday (or day before manager's forecast):
  - Review every open deal in your pipeline
  - For each deal, validate:
    * Is the stage correct? (Don't inflate for appearance)
    * Is the close date realistic? (Don't push into the future indefinitely)
    * Is the deal amount accurate? (Reflect any scope changes)
    * What is the specific next action to advance this deal?
  - Move or close stale deals:
    * No activity in 30 days without a valid reason → reassess or close lost
    * Prospect ghosting after proposal → attempt 3 re-engagement touches, then close
  - Calculate pipeline coverage: Total pipeline / quarterly target >= 3x

STEP 3: FORECAST METHODOLOGY
  Forecast categories:
  COMMITTED: Contract out for signature or verbal confirmation received
  (>= 90% probability)
  BEST CASE: Strong buying signals, decision-maker engaged, timeline confirmed
  (60-80% probability)
  PIPELINE: Qualified opportunity, discovery complete, needs identified
  (20-50% probability)
  UPSIDE: Early stage, potential but unqualified
  (< 20% probability, not included in forecast)

  Your forecast to management = Committed + (Best Case x probability factor)
  Rule: Only forecast what you would bet your own money on

STEP 4: REPORTING METRICS
  Track and report weekly:
  - Activities: Calls made, emails sent, meetings held
  - Pipeline: Total value, number of deals, weighted pipeline
  - Conversions: Lead → Meeting, Meeting → Proposal, Proposal → Close
  - Revenue: Closed this month/quarter vs. target
  - Forecast: Committed + Best Case + Pipeline

STEP 5: MONTH-END / QUARTER-END PUSH
  - Identify all deals that can realistically close this period
  - Create urgency: Limited-time pricing, implementation slots, budget cycles
  - Focus 80% of your time on closeable deals, 20% on pipeline building
  - Coordinate with delivery/operations for resource confirmation
  - Get manager support for executive-level engagement if needed
  - After quarter closes: Win/loss analysis on key deals
