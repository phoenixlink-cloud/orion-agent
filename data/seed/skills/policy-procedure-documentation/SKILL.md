STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE NEED

  - SCOPE: Who it applies to
  - DEFINITIONS: Key terms explained
  - POLICY STATEMENT: The rules/requirements
  - PROCEDURE: Step-by-step instructions
  - RESPONSIBILITIES: Who does what
  - EXCEPTIONS: Any approved deviations
  - REFERENCES: Related policies or regulations
  - REVISION HISTORY: Version, date, author, changes

STEP 3: REVIEW AND APPROVE
  - Send draft to relevant stakeholders for review
  - Incorporate feedback and resolve conflicting inputs
  - Submit to management or legal for formal approval
  - Obtain sign-off from the authorising manager

STEP 4: PUBLISH AND COMMUNICATE
  - Upload to the central policy repository (SharePoint, intranet)
  - Send an announcement email with a summary of the policy
  - For significant changes: Hold a brief team meeting or training session

STEP 5: MAINTAIN AND REVIEW
  - Schedule annual reviews for all active policies
