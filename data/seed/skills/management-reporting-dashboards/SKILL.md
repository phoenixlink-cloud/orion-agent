SKILL: MANAGEMENT REPORTING & EXECUTIVE DASHBOARDS

SKILL ID:       FA-SK-003
ROLE:           Financial Analyst
CATEGORY:       Reporting & Communication
DIFFICULTY:     Intermediate to Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 8-16 hours per month for standard reporting

DESCRIPTION
Producing clear, accurate, and actionable financial reports and dashboards
for senior management. This covers monthly management accounts, KPI dashboards,
variance commentary, and the ability to translate complex financial data into
compelling visual narratives that drive decision-making.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DATA COLLECTION (Working days 1-2 of each month)
  - Extract trial balance and financial data from the ERP system
  - Verify month-end close is complete (all journals posted, accruals done)
  - Reconcile key accounts: Cash, receivables, payables, inventory
  - Cross-check data integrity: Row counts, totals, signs

STEP 2: PREPARE MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTS
  Standard management pack structure:
  1. P&L summary: Revenue, COGS, gross profit, opex, EBITDA, net profit
  2. Revenue analysis: By product, segment, geography, customer
  3. Cost analysis: By department, fixed vs. variable, vs. budget
  4. Balance sheet summary: Key asset/liability movements
  5. Cash flow statement: Operating, investing, financing
  6. Working capital metrics: DSO, DPO, DIO, cash conversion cycle
  7. Headcount: FTEs by department, new hires, attrition

STEP 3: BUILD THE EXECUTIVE DASHBOARD
  Key principles for effective dashboards:
  - Start with the ONE number that matters most (revenue, EBITDA, cash)
  - Use traffic lights: Green/amber/red for instant status recognition
  - Show trends: Sparklines, trendlines, rolling averages
  - Compare: Actual vs. budget vs. forecast vs. prior year
  - Limit to 8-12 KPIs per page (avoid information overload)
  - Use consistent formatting: Same colours, fonts, chart types throughout

  Essential KPIs for executive dashboards:
  FINANCIAL:    Revenue, gross margin %, EBITDA, net profit, cash balance
  OPERATIONAL:  Order backlog, utilisation rate, project margins
  COMMERCIAL:   Pipeline value, win rate, customer acquisition cost, churn
  PEOPLE:       Headcount, attrition rate, cost per employee
  EFFICIENCY:   Revenue per employee, operating expense ratio

STEP 4: WRITE VARIANCE COMMENTARY
  For each significant variance (> 5%), provide:
  - WHAT: "Revenue was R2.3M vs. budget of R2.5M (R200K / 8% unfavourable)"
  - WHY: "Driven by delayed Project Alpha launch (R150K) and lower volume
    in Segment B (R50K)"
  - SO WHAT: "Full-year impact estimated at R400K if not recovered"
  - NOW WHAT: "Project Alpha launching in March; Segment B pricing review
    in progress — expect recovery in Q2"

  Commentary rules:
  - Lead with the number, then the story
  - Quantify everything — "significant" and "substantial" are not numbers
  - Be honest about bad news — executives respect candour
  - Separate one-offs from underlying trends
  - End with forward-looking outlook and actions

STEP 5: QUALITY ASSURANCE
  Before distribution:
  [ ] Numbers tie to the ERP / source system
  [ ] P&L, BS, and CF are internally consistent
  [ ] Comparatives are correct (prior year, budget, forecast)
  [ ] Percentages and ratios are calculated correctly
  [ ] Charts are properly scaled and labelled
  [ ] Commentary matches the numbers shown
  [ ] Spelling and grammar are correct
  [ ] Confidentiality classification is marked
  [ ] Distribution list is correct (no unintended recipients)

STEP 6: DISTRIBUTE AND PRESENT
  - Send the report by working day 5 (or agreed deadline)
  - Offer a 15-minute walkthrough call for key stakeholders
  - Be prepared to answer detailed questions on any line item
  - Track action items arising from the review
  - File the report in the archive (with version and date)

TOOLS & RESOURCES
- Power BI / Tableau / Looker for interactive dashboards
- Excel for data preparation and detailed analysis
- ERP system for source data (SAP, Oracle, NetSuite, Xero)
- PowerPoint for static report distribution
- Report template library (standardised formats)
- Data visualisation best practices guide

QUALITY STANDARDS
- Report accuracy: Zero material errors
- Delivery: 100% by working day 5
- Commentary: Complete for all items > 5% variance
- Dashboard uptime: Interactive dashboards refreshed daily
- Stakeholder satisfaction: >= 4.2/5.0 on usefulness and clarity
