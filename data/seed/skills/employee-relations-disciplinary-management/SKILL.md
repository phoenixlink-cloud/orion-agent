SKILL: EMPLOYEE RELATIONS & DISCIPLINARY MANAGEMENT

SKILL ID:       HR-SK-002
ROLE:           HR Manager
CATEGORY:       Employee Relations
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: Variable (2-20 hours per case)

DESCRIPTION
Managing workplace relationships, resolving conflicts, handling grievances,
and administering fair disciplinary processes in compliance with labour
legislation. This skill requires empathy, impartiality, legal knowledge,
and the ability to balance employee welfare with organisational interests.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: RECEIVE THE COMPLAINT OR ISSUE
  Sources: Employee complaint, manager report, anonymous hotline, observation
  - Document the initial report: Date, reporter, nature of issue, parties involved
  - Assess urgency: Immediate safety concern? Harassment? Theft? Or performance issue?
  - Determine jurisdiction: HR matter? Legal? Compliance? External authority?

STEP 2: CONDUCT A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT
  - Gather initial facts without making judgements
  - Review relevant policies: Code of conduct, disciplinary code, grievance procedure
  - Determine if a formal investigation is required
  - If urgent (harassment, safety): Implement interim measures immediately
    (separation of parties, temporary reassignment, suspension with pay)

STEP 3: FORMAL INVESTIGATION (if required)
  - Appoint an impartial investigator (HR or external, depending on severity)
  - Interview all relevant parties separately and confidentially:
    * The complainant: What happened? When? Where? Witnesses? Evidence?
    * The respondent: Their account of events, response to allegations
    * Witnesses: What did they see/hear? Corroborating details?
  - Collect documentary evidence: Emails, CCTV, attendance records, etc.
  - Document everything meticulously (these records may be needed in legal proceedings)
  - Prepare an investigation report with findings and recommendations

STEP 4: GRIEVANCE RESOLUTION
  For employee-raised grievances:
  - Acknowledge the grievance in writing within 48 hours
  - Schedule a formal grievance hearing within 5 business days
  - Hear the employee's case fully; allow them representation if desired
  - Investigate and respond in writing within 10 business days
  - If unresolved: Offer appeal process to a more senior manager
  - Track resolution to ensure the issue does not recur

STEP 5: DISCIPLINARY PROCESS
  Progressive discipline steps:
  1. VERBAL WARNING: Minor first offence, documented in file, valid 3-6 months
  2. WRITTEN WARNING: Repeated minor offence or moderate misconduct, valid 6-12 months
  3. FINAL WRITTEN WARNING: Serious misconduct or continued poor performance, valid 12 months
  4. DISMISSAL: Gross misconduct or failure to improve after final warning

  For each step:
  - Issue a notice to attend a disciplinary hearing (minimum 48 hours notice)
  - Inform the employee of their right to representation
  - Conduct a fair hearing: Present evidence, hear the employee's response
  - Consider mitigating and aggravating factors
  - Issue the outcome in writing within 5 business days
  - Inform the employee of their right to appeal

STEP 6: CONFLICT MEDIATION (informal resolution)
  When formal processes are not required:
  - Meet with each party separately to understand their perspective
  - Identify common ground and shared interests
  - Facilitate a joint discussion focused on solutions (not blame)
  - Agree on specific behaviour changes and follow-up timeline
  - Document the agreement and check in after 2-4 weeks
