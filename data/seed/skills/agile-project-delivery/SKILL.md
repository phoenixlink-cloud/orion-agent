SKILL: AGILE PROJECT DELIVERY (SCRUM & KANBAN)

SKILL ID:       PM-SK-004
ROLE:           Project Manager
CATEGORY:       Methodology & Delivery
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: Ongoing (embedded in daily project rhythm)

DESCRIPTION
Delivering projects using Agile methodologies (Scrum and Kanban), including
sprint planning, backlog management, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and
retrospectives. This skill enables iterative delivery of value, rapid feedback
loops, and adaptive planning in environments with evolving requirements.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: SET UP THE AGILE FRAMEWORK
  Choose the methodology:
  SCRUM: Fixed-length sprints (2-4 weeks), defined roles, ceremonies
  KANBAN: Continuous flow, WIP limits, no fixed iterations
  HYBRID: Scrum ceremonies with Kanban board (common in practice)

  Scrum roles:
  - Product Owner: Defines what to build (prioritises backlog)
  - Scrum Master / PM: Facilitates process, removes impediments
  - Development Team: Cross-functional team that delivers the work

STEP 2: BUILD AND GROOM THE BACKLOG
  - Product Owner creates user stories in the format:
    "As a [user type], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
  - Add acceptance criteria: Specific conditions for "done"
  - Estimate effort using story points (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
  - Prioritise using MoSCoW: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have
  - Groom (refine) the backlog weekly: Break down large stories, clarify requirements

STEP 3: SPRINT PLANNING (Every 2 weeks)
  - Review team velocity (average story points completed per sprint)
  - Product Owner presents the top-priority stories
  - Team discusses, clarifies, and commits to a sprint goal
  - Move committed stories from backlog to sprint board
  - Break stories into tasks with hour estimates
  - Sprint capacity check: Available hours vs. estimated hours

STEP 4: DAILY STAND-UP (15 minutes, every day)
  Each team member answers:
  1. What did I complete yesterday?
  2. What will I work on today?
  3. Are there any blockers or impediments?
  
  PM/Scrum Master:
  - Note blockers and take action to resolve them
  - Update the sprint board
  - Keep the meeting to 15 minutes (no problem-solving in stand-up)

STEP 5: SPRINT REVIEW / DEMO (End of each sprint)
  - Team demonstrates completed work to stakeholders
  - Product Owner accepts or rejects each story based on acceptance criteria
  - Gather feedback for future backlog items
  - Celebrate completed work — recognition motivates teams

STEP 6: RETROSPECTIVE (End of each sprint)
  Facilitate a team discussion:
  - What went well? (Keep doing)
  - What didn't go well? (Stop or improve)
  - What should we try? (New experiments)
  
  Select 2-3 actionable improvements for the next sprint
  Track retrospective actions to ensure follow-through

STEP 7: KANBAN FLOW MANAGEMENT (if using Kanban)
  Board columns: Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Review → Done
  - Set WIP (Work In Progress) limits for each column
  - Measure cycle time: How long from "In Progress" to "Done"?
  - Optimise flow: Reduce bottlenecks, balance workload
  - Use cumulative flow diagrams to visualise throughput

AGILE METRICS TO TRACK
- Velocity: Story points completed per sprint (trend over time)
- Sprint burndown: Daily progress toward sprint goal
- Cycle time: Average time from start to completion per story
- Throughput: Number of items completed per time period
- Sprint goal achievement: % of sprints where the goal was met
- Defect rate: Bugs found post-sprint as % of stories delivered
- Team happiness: Retrospective health check scores

TOOLS & RESOURCES
- JIRA / Azure DevOps / Linear (backlog and sprint management)
- Trello / Monday.com (Kanban boards)
- Confluence / Notion (documentation and retrospective notes)
- Burndown chart generator
- Planning poker tool (for estimation sessions)
- Retrospective facilitation tools (EasyRetro, Retrium)

QUALITY STANDARDS
- Sprint planning: 100% of sprints have a defined goal and committed backlog
- Daily stand-up: < 15 minutes, 100% team attendance
- Sprint review: Stakeholders attend >= 80% of demos
- Retrospective: Conducted every sprint; actions tracked
- Velocity: Stable or improving trend over 5+ sprints
- Sprint goal achievement: >= 80%
