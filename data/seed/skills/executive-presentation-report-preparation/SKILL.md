SKILL: EXECUTIVE PRESENTATION & REPORT PREPARATION

SKILL ID:       EA-SK-005
ROLE:           Executive Assistant
CATEGORY:       Document Preparation
DIFFICULTY:     Advanced
ESTIMATED TIME: 2-6 hours per deliverable

DESCRIPTION
Creating polished, executive-grade presentations, reports, and briefing
documents that effectively communicate complex information. This skill covers
PowerPoint/Keynote design, data visualisation, narrative structure, brand
compliance, and the ability to translate raw data into compelling stories.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE

STEP 1: RECEIVE THE BRIEF
  Clarify with the executive:
  - Audience: Board? Investors? Internal team? Clients?
  - Purpose: Inform? Persuade? Decide? Celebrate?
  - Key message: What is the ONE takeaway?
  - Data sources: Which reports, spreadsheets, or documents to reference?
  - Format: Presentation slides, written report, one-pager, infographic?
  - Deadline: When is the final version needed? When is the dry-run?
  - Brand: Use corporate template? Custom design?

STEP 2: STRUCTURE THE CONTENT
  Presentation framework:
  1. Title slide: Meeting name, date, presenter, classification
  2. Executive summary: Key points in 3-5 bullets (for time-pressed readers)
  3. Context: Why are we discussing this? Background and situation
  4. Data/Analysis: Charts, graphs, key metrics with commentary
  5. Options/Recommendations: What the executive proposes
  6. Decision required: Clear ask — what does the audience need to decide?
  7. Next steps: Actions, owners, timelines
  8. Appendix: Supporting detail for reference

STEP 3: DESIGN & BUILD
  Slide design principles:
  - One idea per slide (the "billboard test")
  - Maximum 6 lines of text per slide; use visuals wherever possible
  - Consistent colour palette from the brand guide
  - Data charts: Simple, labelled, with a clear takeaway in the title
    (e.g., "Revenue grew 23% YoY" not just "Revenue Chart")
  - Use high-quality images; never stretch or pixelate
  - Animate sparingly — entrance animations for reveal, nothing distracting
  - Ensure readability from the back of the room (min 24pt for body text)

STEP 4: REVIEW AND REFINE
  Self-review checklist:
  [ ] Spelling and grammar: Zero errors
  [ ] Numbers: Cross-checked against source data
  [ ] Brand compliance: Correct logo, colours, fonts
  [ ] Flow: Does the narrative build logically?
  [ ] Timing: Can it be delivered in the allotted time? (1 min per slide)
  [ ] Accessibility: Colour contrast, alt text for images
  [ ] Printability: Does it look good in printed/PDF form?

  Submit to executive for review:
  - Send 48 hours before the presentation for feedback
  - Incorporate changes and send final version 24 hours before
  - Prepare a printed backup copy

STEP 5: SUPPORT THE DELIVERY
  - Load the presentation on the meeting room laptop/screen
  - Test AV: Projector, clicker, audio (if video content)
  - Have a backup on USB and in email/cloud
  - Be ready to advance slides or pull up appendix material
  - Take notes on audience questions for follow-up
