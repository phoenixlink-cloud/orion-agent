# Supporting Orion Development

## About This Project

Orion Agent is an open-source, multi-agent AI coding assistant developed and maintained by **Phoenix Link (Pty) Ltd**. The project is released under the AGPL-3.0 license, meaning it is free to use, modify, and distribute under the terms of that license.

## Why Support Orion?

Maintaining and developing Orion requires significant time and resources:

- **Core Development** -- New features, agent improvements, memory system enhancements
- **Security** -- Regular audits, vulnerability fixes, AEGIS governance hardening
- **Infrastructure** -- Testing environments, CI/CD, documentation hosting
- **Community Support** -- Issue triage, documentation, onboarding guides
- **Long-term Sustainability** -- Ensuring Orion remains actively maintained

## How to Contribute Financially

If Orion has benefited you in any way and you would like to see its continued development, please consider supporting the project by making a voluntary financial contribution.
