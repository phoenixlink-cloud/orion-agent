## Dual Licensing Model

Orion Agent is available under two licensing options:

### Option 1: Open Source (AGPL-3.0)

The open source version is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0**.

| Permitted | Required | Not Permitted |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Use for any purpose | Disclose source code | Proprietary modifications |
| Modify the software | License modifications under AGPL-3.0 | Closed-source SaaS |
| Distribute copies | Provide source to network users | Sublicense under other terms |
| Commercial use (with AGPL compliance) | State changes made | |

**Key AGPL-3.0 requirement:** If you modify Orion and provide it as a network service (SaaS), you must make your modified source code available to users of that service under AGPL-3.0.

### Option 2: Commercial License

For organizations that cannot comply with AGPL-3.0 requirements, Phoenix Link offers commercial licensing.

**When you need a commercial license:**

- Offering Orion as a hosted service (SaaS) without open-sourcing modifications
- Keeping your modifications and customizations private
- Embedding Orion in applications distributed without source code
- Using Orion in environments where AGPL-3.0 is not approved
