# Contributor License Agreement

## Phoenix Link (Pty) Ltd -- Individual Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Orion Agent. This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to Phoenix Link (Pty) Ltd.

### 1. Definitions

**"You"** (or **"Contributor"**) means the individual signing this Agreement.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to existing work, that you submit to Phoenix Link for inclusion in Orion Agent. This includes code, documentation, tests, and any other materials.

**"Submit"** means any form of communication sent to Phoenix Link, including pull requests, issues, emails, and other electronic or written correspondence.

**"Phoenix Link"** means Phoenix Link (Pty) Ltd, the owner and steward of Orion Agent.

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

You hereby grant to Phoenix Link a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to:

- Reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute your Contributions and derivative works
- Sublicense any or all of the foregoing rights to third parties

### 3. Grant of Patent License

You hereby grant to Phoenix Link a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your Contributions, where such license applies only to patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contributions alone or by combination with Orion Agent.

### 4. Dual Licensing Rights

You acknowledge and agree that:

- Orion Agent is distributed under a dual-licensing model (AGPL-3.0 and commercial licenses)
- Phoenix Link may include your Contributions in both open source and commercial versions
- Phoenix Link may sublicense your Contributions under terms different from AGPL-3.0, including proprietary licenses
- Phoenix Link may relicense your Contributions in the future under different open source or proprietary licenses

### 5. Your Rights

You retain copyright ownership of your Contributions. This Agreement does not transfer copyright ownership; it grants Phoenix Link the licenses described above.

You are free to use, modify, and distribute your Contributions in your own projects and to grant licenses to your Contributions to others.

### 6. Clarification of Rights

To ensure complete clarity about what you can and cannot do:

**You CAN:**

- Use your original Contribution code in any other project (commercial or open source)
- License your original Contribution code to any third party under any terms
- Sell products or services that incorporate your original Contribution code (independent of Orion)
- Publicly discuss, present, or write about your Contribution
- List the Contribution on your resume, portfolio, or professional profiles

**You CANNOT:**

- Revoke the license granted to Phoenix Link for Contributions already submitted
- Prevent Phoenix Link from using your Contribution in commercial Orion licenses
- Claim exclusive rights to features you contributed to Orion (Phoenix Link has equal rights)
- Sell or sublicense Orion itself (including your Contributions as part of Orion) under terms other than AGPL-3.0 without a commercial license from Phoenix Link

**Important Distinction:**

- **Your original code** = Code you wrote that could exist independently
- **Orion derivative** = Any work that incorporates Orion's codebase

You retain full rights to your original code. Derivatives of Orion (including your contributions integrated into Orion) are governed by Orion's dual-licensing model.

**Example:**

You contribute a "Kubernetes deployment module" to Orion.

- You can sell that same Kubernetes logic as a standalone product
- You can use it in your company's internal tools
- Phoenix Link can include it in Orion's commercial offering
- You cannot take Orion + your module and sell it as "MyOrion Pro" (that's a derivative requiring commercial license)

### 7. Representations

You represent and warrant that:

1. **Original Work:** Your Contributions are your original creation and you have the right to grant the licenses in this Agreement.

2. **No Conflicting Obligations:** Your Contributions do not violate any agreement you have with a third party, including your employer.

3. **Employer Authorization:** If your Contributions are made in the course of your employment, you have received permission from your employer to make the Contributions, or your employer has waived such rights, or your employer has signed a Corporate CLA with Phoenix Link.

4. **No Infringement:** To your knowledge, your Contributions do not infringe any third-party intellectual property rights.

### 8. No Obligation

You understand that:

- Phoenix Link is not obligated to use or include your Contributions
- Phoenix Link may reject any Contribution for any reason
- Decisions about the project direction are at Phoenix Link's sole discretion

### 9. Support

You are not expected to provide support for your Contributions unless you choose to do so. Any support provided is at your discretion and without obligation.

### 10. Notification

You agree to notify Phoenix Link if you become aware of any facts or circumstances that would make your representations in this Agreement inaccurate.
