# Copyright & Intellectual Property

## Sole Copyright Owner

**Phoenix Link (Pty) Ltd** is the sole copyright owner of Orion Agent and all associated source code, documentation, and assets in this repository.

## Project Stewardship

Phoenix Link (Pty) Ltd is the exclusive steward of the Orion Agent project:

- All architectural decisions are made by Phoenix Link
- All contributions require Phoenix Link approval
- The project roadmap is determined by Phoenix Link
- Licensing terms are set exclusively by Phoenix Link

## Dual Licensing

Orion Agent is available under two licenses:

1. **AGPL-3.0** -- Free for open source use with copyleft requirements
2. **Commercial License** -- Available from Phoenix Link for proprietary use

See [LICENSE-ENTERPRISE.md](./LICENSE-ENTERPRISE.md) for commercial licensing details.

## Contributions

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA) Required

All contributions to Orion Agent require a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA) **before** any code can be merged.

The CLA grants Phoenix Link (Pty) Ltd:

- The right to use, modify, and distribute your contribution
- The right to sublicense your contribution under any license (including proprietary)
- The right to include your contribution in commercial products
- The right to relicense your contribution in the future

**You retain:**

- Copyright ownership of your original contribution
- The right to use your contribution in your own projects
- Attribution in the project's contributors list (optional)

### Why a CLA?

Orion Agent uses dual licensing (AGPL-3.0 + commercial). For Phoenix Link to offer commercial licenses to enterprise customers, we need unified licensing rights over the entire codebase. The CLA provides this legally while respecting contributor rights.

This model is used by many successful open source projects including Qt, MongoDB, GitLab, and projects under the Apache Software Foundation.

### Contributions Without a Signed CLA

Pull requests from contributors without a signed CLA **will not be merged**. This protects both parties:

- Your rights are clearly defined in a signed agreement
- Phoenix Link's licensing model remains legally sound
- No ambiguity about intellectual property ownership

### How to Sign the CLA

1. Before your first contribution, email **cla@phoenixlink.co.za**
2. Include your GitHub username and a brief description of your intended contribution
3. We'll send you the CLA document within 48 hours
4. Sign electronically and return
5. You're cleared to contribute -- we'll note your GitHub username as approved

For contributions made on behalf of an employer, a **Corporate CLA** is required. Contact cla@phoenixlink.co.za for the corporate agreement.
